The strain sensor can achieve autonomic self-heal electrically and mechanically under ambient conditions, and can sustain extreme elastic strain (1000%) with high gauge factor of 1.51. Furthermore, the strain sensors have good response, signal stability, and repeatability under various human motion detections. Stretchable, wearable, flexible, and human friendly soft electronic devices are of significance to meet the escalating requirements of increasing complexity and multifunctionality of modern electronics.1-6 Strain sensors can generate repeatable electrical changes upon mechanical deformations. They have found particular interest and broad applications in robotics, sports, health monitor, and therapeutics, etc. To date, several representative strain sensors using carbon nanotubes,7-9 metal/semiconductor,10-12 graphene,13-15 conductive polymer,16, 17 and microfluidic18, 19 as conductive materials combining with elastomeric substrates have been successfully fabricated. However, most of these devices can only be stretched to a very limited extent (usually less than 200%). Lewis and co-workers20 have developed a capacitive soft strain sensor using an ionically conductive fluid and silicone elastomer as the conductor and dielectric/encapsulant respectively, which can be stretched up to 700%, but the gauge factor is small (0.348 ± 0.11). We can define the gauge factor as (ΔR/R0)/ε, where ΔR/R0 is relative resistance change, R0 is the resistance at 0% strain, R is the resistance under stretch, and ε is the applied strain.21 In addition, introducing self-healing properties to these soft electronic devices that can repeatably recover mechanical and electrical performance under room temperature, even at the same damaged location or under extremely stretchable situation, is of high importance to avoid the degradation of the device performance during the deformation. Nowadays, self-healing materials have attracted increasing attention, especially in soft electronics field. Haick and co-workers22 have reported a self-healing flexible sensing platform by dispersing metal particles in polyurethane diol as self-healing electrode. Bao and co-workers23 have demonstrated a self-healing electronic sensor skin based on nanostructured μNi particles-supramolecular organic composite. Park and co-workers24 have developed self-healing conductive hydrogel by polymerizing pyrrole in agarose solution. However, none of these self-healing electronic devices can be stretched over 100%. Recently, there are intense research on highly stretchable hydrogels, which are mainly focusing on ionic conductors due to their excellent transparency and small resistance variation under high stretching states.25-29 In particular, conductive hydrogels are promising materials for the fabrication of ionic skin, bioelectrodes, and biosensors because many hydrogels with high water concentration have biocompatibility properties.24, 30-32 Therefore, it is of great interest to fabricate highly stretchable self-healing strain sensor by combining the advantages of both biocompatible hydrogels and electronic conductors for applications in robotics, human motion detection, entertainment, medical monitoring, and treatment etc. Herein, we introduce a new type of extremely stretchable self-healing piezoresistive strain sensor using different electronic conductors comprised of single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT), graphene, and silver nanowire in self-healing hydrogel (SWCNT, graphene, and silver nanowire/hydrogel) as the conductive sensing channel built on a commercial transparent elastic substrate. The conductive hydrogel exhibits a fast self-healing capability which can restore 98 ± 0.8% of its initial conductivity within 3.2 s healing time. Moreover, no external stimuli (such as heat, pH, light, or catalyst) are required. The fast self-healing process of the SWCNT/hydrogel ensures rapid recovery of the electrical property of the sensor after being released to the relaxed state and avoids the degradation of the device performance during the large deformation. The self-healing strain sensor is capable of monitoring strain, flexion, and twist forces. Moreover, it can measure and withstand strain up to 1000%, with high gauge factor and excellent cycling stability. Based on these key features, the self-healing strain sensor can be used to accurately detect large-scale human motion by embedding it in gloves, garments, or directly attaching it on skin. The present methodology developed paves the way for practical applications of highly stretchable self-healing strain electronic devices. The fabrication process of conductive hydrogel is illustrated in Figure 1a (see the Experimental Section in the Supporting Information for details). Figure 1b illustrates the key reaction in forming crosslinked hydrogel. Borax, the salt of a strong base and a weak acid, is hydrolyzed in aqueous solution, yielding a boric acid/tetrafunctional borate ion. In the gelation experiments, trigonal planar B(OH)3 and tetrahedral B(OH)4− exist as monomeric species due to the low concentration of borax employed (0.02 m). B(OH)3 is capable of complexing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), however, it cannot produce polyol gels. The main reason is that the complexation reaction occurs through the attachment of boron to adjacent alcohol groups of the same polymeric chain and this prevents cross-linking from taking place. Therefore, the crosslinked hydrogel is formed via tetrafunctional borate ion interaction with –OH group of PVA. The process is particularly effective in forming 3D gel networks. The hydrogen-bonding between tetrafunctional borate ion and –OH group provides the self-healing function because the cross-link is so weak that it is neither resemblance of covalent bond character nor esterification involved.33-35 The hydrogen-bonding can be easily broken and reformed, allowing the hydrogel to self-heal and reform. The cross-links are dynamically associated and dissociated readily under room temperature. The network cross-linked by weak hydrogen-bonding is easily disrupted by a mechanical deformation, however, it is relatively facile for the bonds to reform due to proximity of plenty –OH groups and borate ions, hence allowing self-healing at room temperature. In addition, the PVA-borax hydrogel exhibits non-Newtonian behavior, resulting in flow under low stress and limited dimensional stability.35, 36 Therefore, the sufficient mobility of polymer chain and free tetrafunctional borate ions enables the hydrogen bond across broken interfaces to trigger the self-healing process rapidly and without the need of external stimuli. Although the PVA itself can form hydrogel and autonomously self-healing property according to the previous reports, the concentration of the PVA used is very high and the stretchability is limited.37-39 Before forming the hydrogel, SWCNT and 4 wt% PVA solution were homogeneously mixed under the surfactant assistance of BYK 348 which is a polyether modified siloxane (purchased from BYK-Chemie GmbH). The SWCNT and water are wrapped in the 3D networks during the hydrogel crosslinking process, thereby the conductive self-healing hydrogel was formed as shown in Figure 1c. It is worth noting that most of the free volume (or pores) within the hydrogel is taken up by water. The hydrogel is composed of water with weight percentage more than 95 wt%. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs taken from freeze-dried SWCNT/hydrogel are shown in Figure 1d,e. The microstructure of the freeze-dried SWCNT/hydrogel is 3D porous networks cross-linked by the SWCNT and some immobilized polymer. The porous structure of the SWCNT and polymeric network inside the SWCNT/hydrogel is highly beneficial to the stretchability and facilitating rapid response of hydrogels. In order to reveal the interactions between the PVA and tetrafunctional borate ion, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) experiment was conducted on Spectrum GX FTIR Spectrometer. As shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), the broad and strong peak around 3400 cm−1 is attributed to the symmetrical stretching vibration of –OH groups. The –OH stretching peak is sensitive to hydrogen bonding. Compared with pure PVA, the –OH stretching peak shifts to a higher wavenumber and the peak is enhanced after formation of the hydrogel, indicating the presence of hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups on the PVA molecular chains and tetrafunctional borate ion.40, 41 In addition, dynamic mechanical measurements of the pure hydrogel and SWCNT/hydrogel were carried out to investigate their rheological properties. Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows the changes in the storage (G′, solid symbols) and loss modulus (G″, hollow symbols) as a function of angular frequency for hydrogel and SWCNT/hydrogel. It can be seen that the presence of SWCNT raises the moduli and enhances the elastic response of the hydrogel. In addition, both hydrogels have a solid behavior with the storage modulus exceeding the loss modulus over the entire frequency range. Figure 2a1–a3 shows the representative optical microscope images of how the SWCNT/hydrogel was healed after being completely separated by a scapel. The two fractured surfaces rapidly contact each other after the scapel was removed. The cutting groove was partially healed after 30 s and totally restored to normal after 60 s at room temperature without any external assistance (such as heat, light, and force). To further investigate the healing property of the SWCNT/hydrogel and recovery of the conductivity, the SWCNT/hydrogel was completely bifurcated and then the two furcated parts were rapidly brought together. Figure 2b presents the resistance changes over time of the SWCNT/hydrogel during the cutting and healing process. Once the conductive hydrogel was completely cut off, an open circuit was formed and the resistance changed to infinity. As the two furcated parts were brought together, the resistance dropped quickly and the resistance reached a constant value within 3.2 s. In addition, the self-healing efficiency of the SWCNT/hydrogel was calculated by Rr/Ri (Rr is the recovered conductivity and Ri is the initial conductivity). Rr/Ri is 98.6% after healing for 3.2 s. It is worth noting that the resistance is lower than that of original value at the moment the two furcated parts get in contact, which is due to the transfer of free ions in the hydrogel, similar phenomenon was observed in the reduced graphene oxide based hydrogel.42 Figure 2c shows the repetitive cutting-healing processes with five cycles at the same location. The resistance of the sample is relatively stable during the cycling. The high self-healing efficiency was observed in each cutting-healing process (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The average efficiencies are 98 ± 0.8% for the five self-healing cycles within about 3.2 s, indicating the SWCNT/hydrogel possesses significant and repeatable electrical restoration performance. The self-healing property of SWCNT/hydrogel was also demonstrated on a complete circuit composed of a LED indicator with SWCNT/hydrogel as the conductor, as shown in Figure 2d1–d3. The LED indicator was successfully lighted when a driving voltage of 5 V was applied. The LED indicator was extinguished when the SWCNT/hydrogel was completely bifurcated and the circuit became open-circuit state. Once the two furcated parts were partially brought together, the circuit was restored and the LED indicator could be lighted up again. The demonstration here illustrates that the SWCNT/hydrogel has great potential in applications of self-healing electronic device such as biosensors, electronic skin, wearable electronics, and so on. To evaluate the performance of the strain sensor, we realized the self-healing piezoresistive strain sensor using the SWCNT/hydrogel as conductor, and Scotch permanent clear mounting tape (VHB 4010, 3 m) as elastomeric substrates and encapsulant, as shown in Figure 3a. The high stretchability of both SWCNT/hydrogel and VHB tape allowed the self-healing strain sensor to remain intact up to 1000% strain, the highest value for electronic strain sensor so far, to the best of our knowledge.43-45 The excellent performances of the device are derived from all parts of the device or their coordination with each other. Although the SWCNT/hydrogel itself could not be recovered to the initial state under extreme strain conditions, it can work well when attached to the VHB tape. A strain sensor using the hydrogel without the electronic conducting component (SWCNT) was also prepared on the elastic substrate with the same parameters for comparison. Relative resistance changes versus strains are shown in Figure 3b. The relative resistance change increases with increasing tensile strain. A relative resistance change [(R −R0)/R0 = ΔR/R0, R0 is the resistance at 0% strain, R is the resistance under stretch] of 1514% was observed at 1000% strain for SWCNT/hydrogel, the sensitivity is nearly three times higher than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor (533%). The large resistance change is highly desired for strain sensing applications, which is prerequisite for high sensitivity. Moreover, the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor also showed reproducible and reliable responses to the small strain from 2% to 100% (Figure S4, Supporting Information). These results indicate that the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor can work well from small strain to extreme strain. There are two aspects leading to the piezoresistive effects of SWCNT/hydrogel: one is the intrinsic piezoresistivity of the hydrogel, the other is the change of the contact conditions of SWCNT for electron conduction, such as contact area, loss of contacts and spacing variations upon stretching, and so on. The electrical conductivity of hydrogel without electronic conductor comes from ions conductivity (such as Na+, H+ in the hydrogel).26, 32 In addition, the relative resistance changes versus strains of the strain sensor can fit into a parabolic equation y = Aε2 + Bε + C, where y is the relative resistance changes and ε is the tensile strain.23, 46 There is no relative resistance change when there is no strain applied to the sensor, so C is zero in the equation. Moreover, the value A can be defined as the sensitivity factor. Larger A value leads to more relative resistance changes, corresponding to higher sensitivity in the sensor. Hence, the sensitivity of the strain sensor can be quantified by the equation in Figure 3b. It can be seen that the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor possesses a larger A than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor. Therefore, the sensitivity of the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor is higher than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor, which is consistent with the experimental data. Figure S5 (Supporting Information) shows the photographs of the SWCNT/hydrogel based self-healing strain sensor stretched to different strains. Gauge factor represents the sensitivity of the sensors. Usually, brittle or poorly stretchable conductive materials have higher gauge factor. However, these materials do not possess or only sustain small stretchability. A relatively small strain could result in an irreversible fracture and lead to an infinite gauge factor. In the cases that high stretchability is required, the gauge factor of SWCNT/hydrogel was 0.24 at 100% strain and increased to 1.51 at 1000% strain (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The gauge factor is higher than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor (from 0.09 at 100% strain to 0.53 at 1000% strain), and other piezoresistive electronic strain sensor (0.06 at 200% strain)8 and capacitive soft strain sensors based on ionic conductor (0.348 ± 0.11 at 700% strain).20 Although some strain sensors exhibit much higher gauge factors, the poor stretchability and lack of self-healing capability restrict their applications under rigorous mechanical deformations.47-49 The responses of the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor for other types of deformation such as flexion and twist which are related to human body movements were also tested. Figure 3c displays the resistance change as a function of flexion angle for the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor. When the sensor was flexed, tensile stress built up at the outer curvature and compressive force built at the inner curvature. The conductive SWCNTs are separated from one another at the outer curvature and approached closer to one another at the inner curvature. However, the separated SWCNT played a dominant role for the device, thereby the resistance increased with increasing flexion angle. It can be seen that the resistance increased to 118% from its original value with bending angle increasing from 0° to 150°. When the strain sensor was twisted, the resistance changes versus twist angle still obeys the flexion parabolic equation within the twist angle of less than 540° as shown in the Figure 3d. However, the conductive SWCNT will be separated from one another around the twist point under larger twist angle (more than 540°), hence, the resistance of the device rapidly increases with increasing twist angle that detaches the SWCNT contacts or entanglements. The sensor responds to the twist angle with a good sensitivity, the resistance increases to 457% from the value of the untwisted state after two revolutions (720°) as shown in Figure 3d. The stability of the sensor was also investigated by repeatedly applying 700% stretching strain to the sensor and the resistance was measured at the released state (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The resistance of the sensor remains almost constant with minor fluctuations within 10% within the first 700 cycles strain test (between 0% to 700% strain). However, the largest resistance fluctuations were observed after 700 cycles due to partial water evaporation of the hydrogel during the long-term cycles. The loss of water from hydrogels might become significant in long-term cycles, which can be reduced by an appropriate encapsulation. Finding ideal packaging materials and technology for long lifetimes is a large undertaking beyond the scope of this paper. We suggest that SWCNT/hydrogel with 1000% stretchability is a superior candidate for strain sensing applications, considering the fast self-healing property and significantly improved piezoresistive responses compared to the hydrogel without electronic conductor counterparts. The excellent sensing performances were not only observed in SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor, but could also be achieved on graphene/hydrogel based strain sensor and silver nanowire/hydrogel based strain sensor (Figure S8 and Figure S9, Supporting Information). A relative resistance change of 916% and gauge factor of 0.92 were observed at 1000% strain for graphene/hydrogel. The silver nanowire/hydrogel based strain sensor exhibits high relative resistance change of 2249% and gauge factor of 2.25 at 1000% strain. However, the silver nanowire/hydrogel based strain sensor is not stable due to the easy oxidation of silver nanowires in water and air. The results indicate that the outstanding sensor performance can be obtained on various electronic conductor/hydrogel based strain sensors. The self-healing SWCNT/hydrogel is promising material platform for wearable strain sensor. For demonstration, the SWCNT/hydrogel based sensor was mounted on the white cotton glove, garment, or directly attached on the skin to detect the bending and stretching of the human body, such as finger knuckle, knee joint, neck and elbow joint. Figure 4a shows the motion detection for the index finger. We checked the response behaviors of the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor when the fingers were repeatedly bent at a frequency of 1 Hz. It can be seen that the sensor responded to the motion of the finger rapidly and repeatedly. The background noise is corresponding to the slight trembling of the finger that can be detected by the SWCNT/hydrogel strain sensor, indicating the high sensitivity of the sensor. Figure 4b illustrates the detection of knee joint bending, the sensor is stretched when the bending angles are at 79.8°, 92.5°, 122.7°, respectively, and released when straightening the knee, the resistance increases during the bending and recover during the releasing process. It can be seen that the resistance of the sensor increased as the bending angle increased. Moreover, the sensor is capable of distinguishing the different bending angles of the knee. When the knee was held at a certain angle, the resistance of SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor remained at a constant value and returned to the original value after straightening the knee. Furthermore, when the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor was used to further monitor other human-motion such as neck bending and elbow bending, sharp and rapid responses were also observed as shown in Figure 4c,d, respectively. Although a slight drift is noticed in these responses, the sensor exhibited good stability and repeatability in the signal. The hysteresis of the sensor in the response could lead to the signal drift. Figure S10 (Supporting Information) depicts the relative resistance changes of 1000% and 100% strain under stretching–releasing cycles, significant hysteresis is observed during the 1000% stretching–releasing cycling. The hysteresis is caused by rearrangement of the CNT in the hydrogel matrix and the considerable hysteresis of VHB tape. However, even in this case, the original resistance of the sensor is almost fully recovered after releasing it from strain and the hysteresis is negligible within 100% strain. Moreover, the sensor also has important advantages of low creep and fast response. As seen in Figure S11 (Supporting Information), a step strain of 100% was imposed within 1 s, revealing a percent overshoot and creep recovery time of 7.4% and 0.7 s, respectively, which can be attributed to the excellent self-healing property of the conductive SWCNT/hydrogel. The differences in the degree of muscle movements could lead to a slight drift. In order to prove this, the response behavior of the sensor was also investigated by repeatedly applying 100% stretching strain to the sensor as shown in Figure S12 (Supporting Information). It can be seen that the sensor exhibits a negligible drift under the constant strain. These results demonstrate that our strain sensors can be used as human motion sensor and have the potential application in a wide range of stretchable devices. In summary, the present work first demonstrated the extremely stretchable self-healing strain sensors based on various repeatable self-healing conductive hydrogels such as SWCNT, graphene, and silver nanowire/hydrogel under ambient conditions. The conductive SWCNT/hydrogel exhibits fast electrical healing speed (within 3.2 s) and high self-healing efficiency (98 ± 0.8%). The strain sensor is capable of sustaining severe elastic deformation (up to 1000%) with high gauge factor of 1.51. After being stretched to 700% strain for 1000 cycles, no significant change was observed in the intrinsic properties of the strain sensor. The electrical resistance can effectively recover by self-healing of the conductive SWCNT/hydrogel. Furthermore, the strain sensor could effectively monitor and distinguish multifarious human motion when used as wearable strain sensor. We found that the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensors have good response, stability, and repeatability of the signal during the human motion detection measurements. We believe that our extremely stretchable self-healing strain sensor could find a wide range of applications in robotics, sports, health monitoring, and medical treatments.

A new trimethylaluminum vapor-based crosslinking method to render the nanocrystal films insoluble is applied. The resulting near-complete nanocrystal film coverage, coupled with the natural confinement of injected charges within the perovskite crystals, facilitates electron–hole capture and give rise to a remarkable electroluminescence yield of 5.7%. Metal-halide perovskite semiconductors have attracted significant research interest, due to a combination of low-cost solution processability and remarkable performance in optoelectronic devices.1, 2 In 2014, we demonstrated infrared and visible electroluminescence in methylammonium lead halide perovskites, using a charge-confined diode structure to achieve effective radiative recombination.2-4 However, the use of methylammonium halide, which is a chemical combination of gaseous methylamine and hydrogen halide, necessarily limits the thermal stability of these perovskite devices. Replacing methylammonium with inorganic cesium offers the perovskite extra thermal stability up to its melting at ≈500 °C, but makes it more intractable toward solution processing.5 Recently, Protesescu et al. demonstrated the synthesis of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals,6 following the traditional approaches of growing and stabilizing semiconductor particles in the presence of aliphatic ligands.7 These perovskite nanocrystals are highly luminescent and emit over the full visible range, making them ideal candidates for luminescent display applications.6 The synthetic steps are generally straightforward, and the easy control of halide content allows the perovskite bandgaps to be tailored, both by chemical compositions as well as by quantum size effects. So far, perovskite nanocrystals are shown to have color-pure emission, close to unity photoluminescence yield and low lasing thresholds.8 These nanocrystals were also attempted in light-emitting devices, but efficiencies remain modest at 0.12%.9 Here, we show the preparation of highly efficient perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLED) using solution-processed nanocrystals. We apply a new trimethylaluminum (TMA) vapor-based crosslinking method to render the nanocrystal films insoluble, thereby allowing the deposition of subsequent charge-injection layers without the need for orthogonal solvents. The resulting near-complete nanocrystal film coverage, coupled with the natural confinement of injected charges within the perovskite crystals, facilitate electron–hole capture and give rise to a remarkable electroluminescence yield of 5.7%. Figure 1a shows the device architecture of our perovskite nanocrystal light-emitting diode, and Figure 1b shows the energy-level diagram of the materials within the device stack. Here, our electron-injection layer comprises a film of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals, directly deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate.4 The cesium lead halide nanocrystals were solution-coated onto the ZnO film as the emissive layer. Due to the presence of aliphatic ligands on the nanocrystals, the perovskite film remains soluble to organic solvents, which limits the deposition of subsequent charge-injection layers using solution methods. We employed a new TMA vapor-phase crosslinking technique to fix the nanocrystal film in place, thereby enabling us to solution-cast a layer of TFB polymer (poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine)]) above without washing the nanocrystals off. TFB serves primarily as a hole-injection and electron-blocking layer. A thin, high work-function molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) interlayer and silver electrode were vacuum-thermal evaporated to complete the device. As shown in Figure 1c,d, our perovskite nanocrystal devices show saturated and color-pure emission. We control the perovskite bandgap, primarily by tailoring the halide composition, and achieve electroluminescence across a wide range of the visible spectrum. Our red, orange, green, and blue devices emit at wavelengths of 698, 619, 523, and 480 nm, respectively. All devices exhibit narrow-width emission, with their full-width at half maxima (FWHM) in the range of 17–31 nm. The red and green LEDs were made, respectively, from the pure iodide and pure bromide perovskites, while the orange and blue LEDs were made from mixed-halide perovskites, with CsPbI2.25Br0.75 and CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5 compositions, respectively. The crosslinking of the perovskite nanocrystals was critical toward the realization of our device structure. Traditionally, nanocrystals have been crosslinked, or made insoluble, using ligand exchange techniques, where shorter-chain bi-functionalized organic ligands (e.g., diamines or dithiols) were applied to replace the longer-chain oleyl ligands.11 However, the replacement with smaller ligands often creates cracks and gaps within the nanocrystal film, which could lead to electrical shunts and reduced device performance.12 Closer packing of the nanocrystals could also lead to the self-quenching of the nanocrystals and a lower photoluminescence yield,13 often caused by a more effective Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET) to non-radiative sites.14 Here, crosslinking is achieved by exposing the perovskite nanocrystal film to short pulses of TMA vapor within an enclosed vacuum chamber at room temperature, followed by standing the treated film in ambient air. This creates a well-connected network of hydroxide-terminated aluminum oxide that links the nanocrystals together, hence rendering them insoluble. This vapor-phase technique does not involve ligand exchange processes, and is therefore useful in crosslinking the nanocrystals without altering the original crystal arrangements, thereby allowing much of the film's original structural and electronic properties to be preserved. The photoluminescence spectra of the nanocrystals also remain unchanged after the TMA treatment, hence confirming that the crosslinking has no effect on their optical bandgap. (Note that we use a slightly modified TMA treatment procedure for the blue-emitting nanocrystals—see Figure S1, Supporting Information.) In order to investigate the effectiveness of crosslinking, we varied the exposure of the perovskite nanocrystals to different pulse durations of TMA vapor, and measured the nanocrystal retention upon washing with toluene. The crystal retention ratio was determined using UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 2a, the crosslinking was remarkably rapid even at room temperature, and a near complete retention of nanocrystals was achieved in less than 0.5 s of TMA exposure. The inset scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show a significant wash-off for the non-crosslinked nanocrystals, while the TMA-treated nanocrystals were completely retained after washing. Detailed SEM images and large area scans of the nanocrystal films, upon washing with different organic solvents, are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). Interestingly, we observe a corresponding increase in the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 with TMA treatment, but a decrease in the case of CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5 (see Figure 2b). This PL enhancement is particularly remarkable for the CsPbI3 nanocrystals, raising its PL by more than a factor of 3, from ≈25% in the untreated film to ≈85% in the TMA-treated film. We note that this is possibly one of the highest PLQEs achieved in a non-core–shell structured nanocrystal thin film. In an attempt to unravel the origins of the PL enhancement, we took high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Figure 2c) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images (Figure 2d) of the CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals before and after the TMA treatment, and further analyzed the distribution of main elements within the samples using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectrum imaging (Figure 2e). The nanocrystals show an average size of 19 nm (see Figure S3, Supporting Information), which points to minimal quantum confinement in their electronic bandgap.6 We analyzed the spacing distribution between the nanocrystals in the HRTEM images, and found the average crystal spacing to increase from 1.6 to 1.9 nm upon TMA treatment. We note that a spacing of 1.6 nm between the crystals represents ≈0.55 ligand attachment per unit cell of the perovskite lattice. The spacing distribution analysis is shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information) and further TEM images of CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). By analyzing the EELS spectrum image using a combination of principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and curve-fitting quantification, we were able to map out the distribution of elements, and precisely identify the higher concentrations of aluminum and oxygen elements within the sub-2 nm gaps between the perovskite nanocrystals (Figure 2e). This indicates that the TMA treatment has successfully created an alumina network that covers all areas surrounding and in-between the nanocrystals. The intercalation of alumina among the ligands, therefore, accounts for the small increase in the crystal spacing. While this 0.3 nm increase in spacing may lead to a smaller degree of PL quenching by FRET, it is unlikely to fully account for the threefold enhancement in PL yield. The changes in PL are therefore likely to be chemical in nature, where the introduction of TMA chemically passivates the nanocrystal surface and leads to a reduction in PL-quenching defects.15 To further verify that the aluminum is incorporated between the crystal spacing and not just above the nanocrystal film, we measured the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the sample as a function of film depth, and found aluminum to be quite evenly distributed throughout the entire nanocrystal film thickness (see XPS depth profile in Figure S5, Supporting Information). To elucidate the chemical crosslinking mechanism, we measured the infrared (IR) transmittance spectra of the nanocrystal samples before and after the TMA treatment. For comparison, we also measured the IR spectra of the organic ligands, and plotted them on the same graph in Figure 3a. Three distinct changes could be observed in the IR spectra following the TMA treatment. i) A broad peak centered around 3450 cm−1 is produced in all the TMA-treated samples, signally the presence of O–H stretch. This confirms hydroxide surface terminations as expected for an AlOx network, and the role of ambient water in the crosslinking process. ii) Another broad peak appears around 630 cm−1, and this is characteristic of vibrational modes in alumina.16 iii) A strong and sharp band appears at 1576 cm−1 (for samples containing oleic acid), which can be assigned to weakened C=O stretching. This is particularly clear in the case of TMA-treated oleic acid. It is likely that the bonding of the carboxylate group to the strongly Lewis acidic aluminum causes the C=O bond to be weakened, thereby giving a lower than usual stretching frequency. Interestingly, the C=O stretching band does not appear in the pristine nanocrystal samples, but only emerges after TMA treatment. This is likely to be due to the coordination of the carboxylate group to the nanocrystals, thereby diminishing its oscillator strength. With this information, we propose a reaction mechanism for the cross-linking process as shown in Figure 3b. The introduction of TMA coordinates and reacts with the carboxylate and amino groups of the ligands, adjacent to the nanocrystals. The subsequent exposure to ambient moisture hydrolyzes the remaining methyl-aluminum to give a network of alumina and aluminum hydroxide that are covalently bonded to the ligands. It is likely that the alumina that is formed next to the crystal surface successfully passivates the surface defects, thereby enhancing the crystals' photoluminescence yield. The strongly reactive TMA appears to be benign toward the iodide and bromide perovskites, but causes some level of damage to the chloride perovskites, hence resulting in a degradation of PL in the latter. To further verify the role of ligands in this crosslinking process, we attempted to wash off TMA-treated oleic acid and oleylamine (i.e., no nanocrystals) with toluene. We show in Figure S6 (Supporting Information) that the ligands were crosslinked and insoluble upon TMA treatment, hence indicating that many of the ligands are chemically incorporated into the alumina network across the nanocrystal film. In order to prove the generality of our crosslinking technique, we treated thin films of CdSe and PbS nanocrystals with TMA, and demonstrate them to be insoluble to organic solvents upon treatment (see Figure S7, Supporting Information). The TMA crosslinking method has enabled us to make high-performance light-emitting devices using these nanocrystalline lead halide perovskites. Figure 4a–d shows the detailed device characteristics of our perovskite nanocrystal LEDs. High luminance levels of 2335 and 1559 cd m−2 were achieved in our green and orange-emitting devices, respectively, at current densities of 831 and 852 mA cm−2. As shown in Figure 4b, charge injection turns on efficiently close to the bandgap voltage of the perovskite. To demonstrate the importance of our crosslinking method, we plotted the current–voltage characteristics of the non-TMA-treated CsPbI3 device, and show that the current density is more than an order of magnitude higher than the crosslinked counterpart, even at similar or lower luminance levels. This is a clear indication of current leakage,3 which is a result of voids created from the wash-off of the perovskite nanocrystals. We achieved remarkable external quantum efficiencies (EQE), as high as 5.7%, in the crosslinked red-emitting CsPbI3 device, more than an order of magnitude higher than the non-crosslinked device (see Figure 4c) and a factor of 50 higher than the previous report.9 Correcting for out-coupling losses,17 this would be equivalent to an internal quantum efficiency of ≈26%. We note that our CsPbI3 device emits at 698 nm, close to the edge of human-eye sensitivity, and therefore gives only a modest luminance level of 206 cd m−2 at a current density of 755 mA cm−2. We observed that the EQE of the nanocrystal devices decrease generally with the widening of the perovskite bandgap. This is in line with the trends of a lower PLQE in our green and blue-emitting materials (see Figure 2b). The less-ideal charge injection into larger bandgap perovskites could also result in the lower device efficiencies. Figure 4d gives a summary of the key performance parameters of our nanocrystal LEDs. During our investigation of the mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbI2.25Br0.75 and CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5), we noticed that their emission red-shifts reversibly during device operation, and return slowly toward their original state after resting (see Figure S8, Supporting Information). This emission shift is not observed in the pure-halide samples. This may be related to previous observations on photoluminescence shifts in mixed-halide perovskites upon photoexcitation, which was suggested to be due to phase segregation into purer halide phases.18 We note that our films consist of spatially separated nanocrystals, and any phase segregation or halide rearrangements could therefore occur only within a small domain of less than 20 nm. We further show in Figure S9 (Supporting Information) that the EL shifts are completely consistent with the PL shifts, thereby confirming that these shifts are a result of intrinsic changes within the perovskites, and not due to a change in the device charge-injection properties during operation. In view of the emission shifts in mixed-halide systems, bandgap tuning of pure-halide perovskites via quantum size effect may emerge as the more successful strategy for consumer display applications, where stringent requirements on emission stability are demanded. We have now successfully departed from the traditional core–shell nanocrystal approach, and shown that highly efficient electroluminescence could be realized in semiconductor nanocrystals using a simple TMA crosslinking technique. The remarkable ability of alumina to double as a surface passivating agent further makes the TMA treatment an attractive technique for the fabrication of quantum-dot optoelectronic devices. Indeed, given their intensely luminescent properties, versatile color tuning, coupled with an enhanced thermal stability, these all-inorganic lead halide perovskites may quickly emerge as strong contenders in the color display industry. Materials: TFB was provided by Cambridge Display Technology (CDT) and was used as received. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, and were used as received. Synthesis of CsPbX3 (X =Cl, Br, I) Nanocrystals: Perovskite nanocrystals were synthesized using previously reported procedures.6 Cs2CO3 (0.814g, 99.9%) was loaded into 100 mL three-neck flask along with octadecene (ODE) (30 mL, 90%) and oleic acid (OA) (2.5 mL, 90%), and the mixture was dried for 2 h at 120 °C under N2. The solution temperature was then lowered to 100 °C. ODE (75 mL), oleylamine (OLA) (7.5 mL, 90%), and dried OA (7.5 mL) and PbX2 (2.82 mmol) such as PbI2 (1.26 g, 99.99%), PbBr2 (1.035 g, 99.99%), PbCl2 (0.675g, 99.99%), or their mixtures were loaded into a 250 mL three-neck flask and dried under vacuum for 2 h at 120 °C. After complete solubilization of the PbX2 salt, the temperature was raised to 170 °C and the Cs-oleate solution (6.0 mL, 0.125 m in ODE, prepared as described above) was quickly injected. After 10 s, the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice-water bath. For CsPbCl3 synthesis, 1 mL of trioctylphosphine (TOP) (97%) was added to solubilize PbCl2. The nanocrystals were precipitated from solution by the addition of equal volume anhydrous butanol (BuOH) (99%) (ODE:BuOH = 1:1 by volume). After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the nanocrystals were redispersed in anhydrous hexane (99%) and precipitated again with the addition of BuOH (hexane:BuOH = 1:1 by volume). These were redispersed in hexane. The nanocrystal dispersion was filtered through a 0.2 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter and diluted to 10 mg mL−1 in hexane before use. Synthesis of ZnO Nanocrystals: Colloidal ZnO nanocrystals were synthesized by a solution-precipitation process according to previously reported procedures.19 Typically, zinc acetate dihydrate (329 mg) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (0.5 m) by stirring at room temperature. A solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) (453 mg) in ethanol (5 mL) was then added dropwise within 5 min. After 2 h, the product mixture was decanted and washed twice with ethyl acetate and ethanol. Ethanol (6 mL) was added to disperse the precipitate and produce a colloidal ZnO nanocrystal dispersion with a concentration of ≈7 mg mL−1. The dispersion was filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter before use. Crosslinking of Perovskite Nanocrystals: A BENEQ TFS20 atomic layer deposition (ALD) system was used for the vapor-phase crosslinking treatment. High-purity TMA was purchased from SAFC Hitech. The deposition temperature was set at 18 ± 1 °C, which is also the typical ambient room temperature. The reactor chamber was pumped down below 0.2 mbar before starting the process. TMA was applied in short pulses at a partial pressure of ≈0.01 mbar. The dosage of TMA was controlled by varying the total length of TMA pulses between 0.25 and 20 s. The duration of each pulse was limited to 1 s, hence a 10 s dosage is, for instance, achieved with 10 × 1 s pulses. LED Device Fabrication: A 7 mg mL−1 dispersion of ZnO nanocrystals in ethanol was spin-coated onto an ITO-coated glass substrate at 1500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox to give a 15 nm film. A 10 mg mL−1 perovskite nanocrystal dispersion in hexane was spin-coated at 1000–2000 rpm for 20 s in air to give a 30–50 nm film. The films were allowed to dry in air for ≈10 min, and were transferred into the ALD chamber for crosslinking treatment. Following the crosslinking step, a solution of TFB in toluene (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite nanocrystals at 2000 rpm for 30 s in the glovebox to give a 60 nm thin film. MoO3 (5 nm) and Ag (80 nm) metal layers were deposited by thermal evaporation in a high vacuum of below 5 × 10−6 mbar. The devices were encapsulated by UV-epoxy. LED Characterization: Current versus voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. The photon flux was measured simultaneously using a calibrated silicon photodiode centered over the light-emitting pixel. Luminance in cd m−2 was calculated based on the emission spectrum of the LED, weighted against the standard luminosity function and on the known spectral response of the silicon photodiode. The external quantum efficiency was calculated assuming a Lambertian emission profile. Electroluminescence spectra were measured using a Labsphere CDS-610 spectrometer. Optical Characterization: In the PL measurements, the nanocrystal films were placed in a nitrogen-flushed integrating sphere and were photoexcited using a 405 nm continuous-wave laser (1.5 mW). The laser and the emission signals were measured and quantified using a calibrated Andor iDus DU490A InGaAs detector for the determination of PL quantum efficiency. UV–visible absorption of the nanocrystal films was measured using an HP 8453 spectrometer. Samples were prepared on fused-silica substrate, using same processing parameters as in device fabrication. FTIR Measurements: Mid-IR FTIR data were measured by an Agilent Technologies Cary 600 Series FTIR spectrometer. Nanocrystals were spin-coated onto a KBr substrate, and measured in the wavenumber range of 5000–500 cm−1. Electron Microscopy: TEM characterization was carried out on close-packed CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that were drop-cast on thin TEM carbon grids. The TEM samples were analyzed in an FEI Tecnai Osiris TEM/STEM 80-200 microscope operated at 200 kV. The HAADF-STEM images were acquired using a Fischione detector. The EELS spectra were acquired using a Gatan Enfinium ER 977 spectrometer equipped with DualEELS. Core-loss and low-loss spectra were acquired quasi-simultaneously over different regions of the specimen, using a 2 nm pixel size and a dispersion of 1 eV per channel. The dwell time was 0.2 s for core-loss spectra and 10 μs for low-loss spectra. Convergence and collection angles were 8.5 and 34 mrad, respectively. The elemental maps were obtained by weighted PCA and ICA.20 The quantification by curve fitting of the ICA results was performed using Hartree–Slater cross sections. All the EELS analysis was performed using the open source software package HyperSpy.21 SEM images were acquired using the in-lens detector in a LEO 1550 system. The acceleration voltage was set at 10 kV. This work was supported by the EPSRC [Grant Nos. EP/M005143/1, EP/J017361/1, and EP/G037221/1]. G.L. thanks Gates Cambridge Trust for funding.

Drawing conclusions about the influence of the components and curing conditions on the mechanical properties of the subsequently formed insoluble networks is challenging. Therefore, an in situ observation of chemical and mechanical characteristics during the photopolymerization reaction is desired. By coupling of an infrared spectrometer with a photorheometer, a broad spectrum of different photopolymerizable formulations can be analyzed during the curing reaction. The rheological information (i.e., time to gelation, final modulus, shrinkage force) can be derived from a parallel plate rheometer equipped with a UV- and IR-translucent window (glass for NIR and CaF2 window for MIR). Chemical information (i.e., conversion at the gel point and final conversion) is gained by monitoring the decrease of the corresponding IR-peak for the reactive monomer unit (e.g., C═C double bond peak for (meth)acrylates, H-S thiol and C═C double bond peak in thiol-ene systems, C-O epoxy peak for epoxy resins). Depending on the relative concentration of reactive functional groups in the sample volume and the intensity of the IR signal, the conversion can be monitored in the near-infrared region (e.g., acrylate double bonds, epoxy groups) or the MIR region (e.g., thiol signal). Moreover, an integrated Peltier element and external heating hood enable the characterization of photopolymerization reactions at elevated temperatures, which also widens the window of application to resins that are waxy or solid at ambient conditions. By switching from water to heavy water, the chemical conversion during photopolymerization of hydrogel precursor formulations can also be examined. Moreover, this device could also represent an analytical tool for a variety of thermally and redox initiated systems.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

A key advantage is that the inherent microporosity of these scaffolds provides cells with a more permissive environment than conventional nanoporous hydrogels. Here, norbornene-bearing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based microgels are assembled into 3D cell-instructive scaffolds using a PEG-dithiol linker and thiol-ene click photopolymerization. The bulk modulus of these materials depends primarily on the crosslink density of the microgel building blocks. However, the linker and initiator concentrations used during assembly have significant effects on cell spreading and proliferation when human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are incorporated in the scaffolds. The cell response is also affected by the properties of the modular microgel building blocks, as hMSCs growing in scaffolds assembled from stiff but not soft microgels activate Yes-associated protein signaling. These results indicate that PEG microgel scaffolds assembled via thiol-ene click chemistry can be engineered to provide a cell-instructive 3D milieu, making them a promising 3D platform for tissue engineering.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Polyisocyanide is well known for its distinctive rodlike helical structure and various applications in chiral recognition, enantiomer separation, circularly polarized luminescence, liquid crystallization, and other fields. Although various methods and catalysts for isocyanide polymerization have been reported, the precise synthesis of helical polyisocyanides with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity, and high tacticity remains a formidable challenge. Owing to a limited synthesis strategy, the controlled synthesis of topological polyisocyanides has barely been realized. This Accounts highlights our recent endeavors to explore novel catalysts for the living polymerization of isocyanides. Fortunately, we discovered that alkyne-Pd(II) catalysts could initiate the living polymerization of isocyanides, resulting in helical polyisocyanides with controlled structures, high tacticity, and tunable compositions. These catalysts are applicable to various isocyanide monomers, including alkyl isocyanides, aryl isocyanides, and diisocyanobenzene derivatives. Incorporating chiral bidentate phosphine ligands onto alkyne-Pd(II) complexes formed chiral Pd(II) catalysts, which promoted the asymmetric living polymerization of achiral isocyanide, yielding single left- and right-handed helices with highly optical activities.Using alkyne-Pd(II) catalysts, various topological polyisocyanides have been facilely prepared, including hybrid block copolymers, bottlebrush polymers, core cross-linked star polymers, and organic/inorganic nanoparticles. For instance, various hybrid block polyisocyanides were easily produced by coupling alkyne-Pd(II)-catalyzed living isocyanide polymerization with controlled radical polymerization and ring-opening polymerization (ROP). Combining the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene with Pd(II)-catalyzed isocyanide polymerization, bottlebrush polyisocyanides and core cross-linked star polymers were easily prepared. Pd(II)-catalyzed living polymerization of poly(lactic acid)s with isocyanide termini resulted in densely grafted bottlebrush polyisocyanides with closely packed side chains. Moreover, the surface-initiated living polymerization of isocyanides produced a family of polyisocyanide-grafted organic/inorganic hybrid nanoparticles using nanoparticles with alkyne-Pd(II) catalysts anchored on the surfaces. Surprisingly, the nanoparticles and star polymers with helical polyisocyanide arms performed exceptionally well in terms of chiral recognition and resolution. Incorporated organocatalysts such as proline and prolinol units onto the pendants of optically active helical polyisocyanides, a family of polymer-based chiral organocatalysts, were generated, which showed significantly improved stereoselectivity for the asymmetric Aldol reaction and Michael addition and can be easily recycled.Using a chiral alkyne-Pd(II) catalyst, single-handed helical polyisocyanides bearing naphthalene and pyrene probes were produced from achiral isocyanide monomers. These polymers showed excellent self-sorting properties as revealed using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) investigation and were self-assembled into two-dimensional (2D) smectic nanostructures driven by both helicity and chain length. Incorporating helical poly(phenyl isocyanide) (PPI) onto semiconducting poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) induced the asymmetric assembly of the resulting P3HT-b-PPI copolymers into single-handed cylindrical micelles with controlled dimensions and tunable photoluminescence.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Most commonly, thermo and pH-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) microgels can be fabricated by precipitation polymerization in the presence of the co-monomer acrylic acid (AAc). Traditionally pNIPAm microgels are synthesized in the presence of a crosslinking agent, such as N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), however, microgels can also be synthesized under 'crosslinker free' conditions. The resulting particles have extremely low (<0.5%), core-localized crosslinking resulting from rare chain transfer reactions. AFM nanoindentation of these ultralow crosslinked (ULC) particles indicate that they are soft relative to crosslinked microgels, with a Young's modulus of ∼10 kPa. Furthermore, ULC microgels are highly deformable as indicated by a high degree of spreading on glass surfaces and the ability to translocate through nanopores significantly smaller than the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles. The size and charge of ULCs can be easily modulated by altering reaction conditions, such as temperature, monomer, surfactant and initiator concentrations, and through the addition of co-monomers. Microgels based on the widely utilized, biocompatible polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) can also be synthesized under crosslinker free conditions. Due to their softness and deformability, ULC microgels are a unique base material for a wide variety of biomedical applications including biomaterials for drug delivery and regenerative medicine.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we propose a NIR light free-radical photoinitiator (PI) fabricated by incorporating oxime-ester coumarin functionality on the surface of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The coumarin groups of PI absorb the light emitted from the UCNP core, whereas the oxime ester groups undergo cleavage to form radicals. Upon irradiation at 980 nm, the mobile radicals, formed in a manner similar to that of dandelion seed release, initiate both free-radical and thiol-ene photopolymerizations. The superior efficiency of dandelion-like PIs assisted photopolymerizations can be attributed to the reduction of energy loss and increased local PI concentration due to Förster resonance energy transfer process and confinement effect, respectively. Moreover, the proposed PI system can initiate polymerization under low-power NIR laser and reduces the thermal side effects. The possibility of its potential use in deep curing applications was also demonstrated.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

This paper reports a facile one-pot strategy to immobilize the biocompatible and fluorescent CDs (∼6 nm) into the glucose-imprinted poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-acrylamide-vinylphenylboronic acid) [poly(NIPAM-AAm-VPBA)] copolymer microgels for continuous optical glucose detection. The CDs designed with surface hydroxyl/carboxyl groups can form complexes with the AAm comonomers via hydrogen bonds and, thus, can be easily immobilized into the gel network during the polymerization reaction. The resultant glucose-imprinted hybrid microgels can reversibly swell and shrink in response to the variation of surrounding glucose concentration and correspondingly quench and recover the fluorescence signals of the embedded CDs, converting biochemical signals to optical signals. The highly imprinted hybrid microgels demonstrate much higher sensitivity and selectivity for glucose detection than the nonimprinted hybrid microgels over a clinically relevant range of 0-30 mM at physiological pH and benefited from the synergistic effects of the glucose molecular contour and the geometrical constraint of the binding sites dictated by the glucose imprinting process. The highly stable immobilization of CDs in the gel networks provides the hybrid microgels with excellent optical signal reproducibility after five repeated cycles of addition and dialysis removal of glucose in the bathing medium. In addition, the hybrid microgels show no effect on the cell viability in the tested concentration range of 25-100 μg/mL. The glucose-imprinted poly(NIPAM-AAm-VPBA)-CDs hybrid microgels demonstrate a great promise for a new glucose sensor that can continuously monitor glucose level change.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Thus, the GO-polymer composite Langmuir films synthesized by interfacial thiol-ene photopolymerization with such a straightforward and clean manner, provide new alternatives for developing chemically modified GO-based hybrid self-assembled films and nanomaterials towards a range of soft matter and graphene applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, the photoactivity of perovskite semiconductors in chemical processes remains relatively unexplored. Here, a general approach toward the synthesis of luminescent perovskite-polymer nanocomposites is reported, whereby perovskite nanocrystals are used as photoinitiators in the polymerization of vinyl monomers. The white-light illumination of a perovskite-monomer mixture triggers a free-radical chain-growth polymerization process, giving rise to high molecular weight polymers of ≈200 kDa. The in situ growth of polymer chains from the perovskite crystal surface allows the formation of individually dispersed nanocrystal cores within an encapsulating polymer matrix, and leads to a significant threefold enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield. This photoluminescence enhancement is attributed to the spatial separation of the perovskite nanocrystals and hence the deactivation of energy transfer to dark crystals. The resulting perovskite-polymer nanocomposites exhibit excellent stability against moisture and are shown to be useful as functional downconversion phosphor films for luminescent displays and lighting.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Given that this process can be performed at high concentrations and under mild reaction conditions, it has the potential to have significant industrial scope. However, given that the majority of industrial (and more specifically biotechnological) formulations contain mixtures of polymers and surfactants, the effect of such surfactants on the PISA process is an important consideration. Thus, to expand the scope of the methodology, the effect of small molecule surfactants on the PISA process, specifically for the preparation of unilamellar vesicles, was investigated. Similar to aqueous photo-PISA findings in the absence of surfactant molecules, the originally targeted vesicular morphology was retained in the presence of varying concentrations of non-ionic surfactants, while a diverse set of lower-order morphologies was observed for ionic surfactants. Interestingly, a critical micelle concentration (CMC)-dependent behavior was detected in the case of zwitterionic detergents. Additionally, tunable size and membrane thickness of vesicles were observed by using different types and concentration of surfactants. Based on these findings, a functional channel-forming membrane protein (OmpF porin), stabilized in aqueous media by surfactant molecules, was able to be directly inserted into the membrane of vesicles during photo-PISA. Our study demonstrates the potential of photo-PISA for the direct formation of protein–polymer complexes and highlights how this method could be used to design biomimicking polymer/surfactant nanoreactors.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

This softness leads to a substantial deformability of such particles at liquid interfaces, which, in turn translates into a complex phase behaviour that can exhibit a phase transition between a non-close packed and a close packed arrangement. Here, we explore how the degree of swellability and deformability - and therefore the softness of the particles - affects the phase behaviour of microgels at the air/water interface upon compression. We use precipitation polymerization to synthesize poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels with similar hydrodynamic radii in the collapsed state and systematically vary the degree of swellability by changing the crosslinking density. We spread these microgels onto the air/water interface of a Langmuir trough and characterize their interfacial properties by surface pressure - area isotherms. Furthermore, we continuously transfer the interfacial microgel monolayer during compression onto a solid substrate, thus encoding the complete phase diagram of the microgels with increasing particle density as a function of the position on the solid substrate. We investigate the microgel arrangement by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy and use image analysis to extract quantitative information on the interparticle distance and degree of order. We find that the phase transition is very sensitive to the crosslinking density and occurs at much lower surface pressures for less deformable particles. The softest microgels do not undergo any phase transition. Instead, the system exhibits pronounced local conformation changes around point defects with local five- and sevenfold symmetries, indicating that the geometry of the assembled structure effectively controls the local pressure experienced by the microgels.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Because of its high resolution and the ability to print living cells, bioprinting has been widely used in artificial tissue and organ generation as well as microscale living cell deposition. In this paper, we present a low-cost stereolithography-based bioprinting system that uses visible light crosslinkable bioinks. This low-cost stereolithography system was built around a commercial projector with a simple water filter to prevent harmful infrared radiation from the projector. The visible light crosslinking was achieved by using a mixture of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel with eosin Y based photoinitiator. Three different concentrations of hydrogel mixtures (10% PEG, 5% PEG + 5% GelMA, and 2.5% PEG + 7.5% GelMA, all w/v) were studied with the presented systems. The mechanical properties and microstructure of the developed bioink were measured and discussed in detail. Several cell-free hydrogel patterns were generated to demonstrate the resolution of the solution. Experimental results with NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells show that this system can produce a highly vertical 3D structure with 50 μm resolution and 85% cell viability for at least five days. The developed system provides a low-cost visible light stereolithography solution and has the potential to be widely used in tissue engineering and bioengineering for microscale cell patterning.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The strain sensor can achieve autonomic self-heal electrically and mechanically under ambient conditions, and can sustain extreme elastic strain (1000%) with high gauge factor of 1.51. Furthermore, the strain sensors have good response, signal stability, and repeatability under various human motion detections. Stretchable, wearable, flexible, and human friendly soft electronic devices are of significance to meet the escalating requirements of increasing complexity and multifunctionality of modern electronics.1-6 Strain sensors can generate repeatable electrical changes upon mechanical deformations. They have found particular interest and broad applications in robotics, sports, health monitor, and therapeutics, etc. To date, several representative strain sensors using carbon nanotubes,7-9 metal/semiconductor,10-12 graphene,13-15 conductive polymer,16, 17 and microfluidic18, 19 as conductive materials combining with elastomeric substrates have been successfully fabricated. However, most of these devices can only be stretched to a very limited extent (usually less than 200%). Lewis and co-workers20 have developed a capacitive soft strain sensor using an ionically conductive fluid and silicone elastomer as the conductor and dielectric/encapsulant respectively, which can be stretched up to 700%, but the gauge factor is small (0.348 ± 0.11). We can define the gauge factor as (ΔR/R0)/ε, where ΔR/R0 is relative resistance change, R0 is the resistance at 0% strain, R is the resistance under stretch, and ε is the applied strain.21 In addition, introducing self-healing properties to these soft electronic devices that can repeatably recover mechanical and electrical performance under room temperature, even at the same damaged location or under extremely stretchable situation, is of high importance to avoid the degradation of the device performance during the deformation. Nowadays, self-healing materials have attracted increasing attention, especially in soft electronics field. Haick and co-workers22 have reported a self-healing flexible sensing platform by dispersing metal particles in polyurethane diol as self-healing electrode. Bao and co-workers23 have demonstrated a self-healing electronic sensor skin based on nanostructured μNi particles-supramolecular organic composite. Park and co-workers24 have developed self-healing conductive hydrogel by polymerizing pyrrole in agarose solution. However, none of these self-healing electronic devices can be stretched over 100%. Recently, there are intense research on highly stretchable hydrogels, which are mainly focusing on ionic conductors due to their excellent transparency and small resistance variation under high stretching states.25-29 In particular, conductive hydrogels are promising materials for the fabrication of ionic skin, bioelectrodes, and biosensors because many hydrogels with high water concentration have biocompatibility properties.24, 30-32 Therefore, it is of great interest to fabricate highly stretchable self-healing strain sensor by combining the advantages of both biocompatible hydrogels and electronic conductors for applications in robotics, human motion detection, entertainment, medical monitoring, and treatment etc. Herein, we introduce a new type of extremely stretchable self-healing piezoresistive strain sensor using different electronic conductors comprised of single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT), graphene, and silver nanowire in self-healing hydrogel (SWCNT, graphene, and silver nanowire/hydrogel) as the conductive sensing channel built on a commercial transparent elastic substrate. The conductive hydrogel exhibits a fast self-healing capability which can restore 98 ± 0.8% of its initial conductivity within 3.2 s healing time. Moreover, no external stimuli (such as heat, pH, light, or catalyst) are required. The fast self-healing process of the SWCNT/hydrogel ensures rapid recovery of the electrical property of the sensor after being released to the relaxed state and avoids the degradation of the device performance during the large deformation. The self-healing strain sensor is capable of monitoring strain, flexion, and twist forces. Moreover, it can measure and withstand strain up to 1000%, with high gauge factor and excellent cycling stability. Based on these key features, the self-healing strain sensor can be used to accurately detect large-scale human motion by embedding it in gloves, garments, or directly attaching it on skin. The present methodology developed paves the way for practical applications of highly stretchable self-healing strain electronic devices. The fabrication process of conductive hydrogel is illustrated in Figure 1a (see the Experimental Section in the Supporting Information for details). Figure 1b illustrates the key reaction in forming crosslinked hydrogel. Borax, the salt of a strong base and a weak acid, is hydrolyzed in aqueous solution, yielding a boric acid/tetrafunctional borate ion. In the gelation experiments, trigonal planar B(OH)3 and tetrahedral B(OH)4− exist as monomeric species due to the low concentration of borax employed (0.02 m). B(OH)3 is capable of complexing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), however, it cannot produce polyol gels. The main reason is that the complexation reaction occurs through the attachment of boron to adjacent alcohol groups of the same polymeric chain and this prevents cross-linking from taking place. Therefore, the crosslinked hydrogel is formed via tetrafunctional borate ion interaction with –OH group of PVA. The process is particularly effective in forming 3D gel networks. The hydrogen-bonding between tetrafunctional borate ion and –OH group provides the self-healing function because the cross-link is so weak that it is neither resemblance of covalent bond character nor esterification involved.33-35 The hydrogen-bonding can be easily broken and reformed, allowing the hydrogel to self-heal and reform. The cross-links are dynamically associated and dissociated readily under room temperature. The network cross-linked by weak hydrogen-bonding is easily disrupted by a mechanical deformation, however, it is relatively facile for the bonds to reform due to proximity of plenty –OH groups and borate ions, hence allowing self-healing at room temperature. In addition, the PVA-borax hydrogel exhibits non-Newtonian behavior, resulting in flow under low stress and limited dimensional stability.35, 36 Therefore, the sufficient mobility of polymer chain and free tetrafunctional borate ions enables the hydrogen bond across broken interfaces to trigger the self-healing process rapidly and without the need of external stimuli. Although the PVA itself can form hydrogel and autonomously self-healing property according to the previous reports, the concentration of the PVA used is very high and the stretchability is limited.37-39 Before forming the hydrogel, SWCNT and 4 wt% PVA solution were homogeneously mixed under the surfactant assistance of BYK 348 which is a polyether modified siloxane (purchased from BYK-Chemie GmbH). The SWCNT and water are wrapped in the 3D networks during the hydrogel crosslinking process, thereby the conductive self-healing hydrogel was formed as shown in Figure 1c. It is worth noting that most of the free volume (or pores) within the hydrogel is taken up by water. The hydrogel is composed of water with weight percentage more than 95 wt%. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs taken from freeze-dried SWCNT/hydrogel are shown in Figure 1d,e. The microstructure of the freeze-dried SWCNT/hydrogel is 3D porous networks cross-linked by the SWCNT and some immobilized polymer. The porous structure of the SWCNT and polymeric network inside the SWCNT/hydrogel is highly beneficial to the stretchability and facilitating rapid response of hydrogels. In order to reveal the interactions between the PVA and tetrafunctional borate ion, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) experiment was conducted on Spectrum GX FTIR Spectrometer. As shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), the broad and strong peak around 3400 cm−1 is attributed to the symmetrical stretching vibration of –OH groups. The –OH stretching peak is sensitive to hydrogen bonding. Compared with pure PVA, the –OH stretching peak shifts to a higher wavenumber and the peak is enhanced after formation of the hydrogel, indicating the presence of hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups on the PVA molecular chains and tetrafunctional borate ion.40, 41 In addition, dynamic mechanical measurements of the pure hydrogel and SWCNT/hydrogel were carried out to investigate their rheological properties. Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows the changes in the storage (G′, solid symbols) and loss modulus (G″, hollow symbols) as a function of angular frequency for hydrogel and SWCNT/hydrogel. It can be seen that the presence of SWCNT raises the moduli and enhances the elastic response of the hydrogel. In addition, both hydrogels have a solid behavior with the storage modulus exceeding the loss modulus over the entire frequency range. Figure 2a1–a3 shows the representative optical microscope images of how the SWCNT/hydrogel was healed after being completely separated by a scapel. The two fractured surfaces rapidly contact each other after the scapel was removed. The cutting groove was partially healed after 30 s and totally restored to normal after 60 s at room temperature without any external assistance (such as heat, light, and force). To further investigate the healing property of the SWCNT/hydrogel and recovery of the conductivity, the SWCNT/hydrogel was completely bifurcated and then the two furcated parts were rapidly brought together. Figure 2b presents the resistance changes over time of the SWCNT/hydrogel during the cutting and healing process. Once the conductive hydrogel was completely cut off, an open circuit was formed and the resistance changed to infinity. As the two furcated parts were brought together, the resistance dropped quickly and the resistance reached a constant value within 3.2 s. In addition, the self-healing efficiency of the SWCNT/hydrogel was calculated by Rr/Ri (Rr is the recovered conductivity and Ri is the initial conductivity). Rr/Ri is 98.6% after healing for 3.2 s. It is worth noting that the resistance is lower than that of original value at the moment the two furcated parts get in contact, which is due to the transfer of free ions in the hydrogel, similar phenomenon was observed in the reduced graphene oxide based hydrogel.42 Figure 2c shows the repetitive cutting-healing processes with five cycles at the same location. The resistance of the sample is relatively stable during the cycling. The high self-healing efficiency was observed in each cutting-healing process (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The average efficiencies are 98 ± 0.8% for the five self-healing cycles within about 3.2 s, indicating the SWCNT/hydrogel possesses significant and repeatable electrical restoration performance. The self-healing property of SWCNT/hydrogel was also demonstrated on a complete circuit composed of a LED indicator with SWCNT/hydrogel as the conductor, as shown in Figure 2d1–d3. The LED indicator was successfully lighted when a driving voltage of 5 V was applied. The LED indicator was extinguished when the SWCNT/hydrogel was completely bifurcated and the circuit became open-circuit state. Once the two furcated parts were partially brought together, the circuit was restored and the LED indicator could be lighted up again. The demonstration here illustrates that the SWCNT/hydrogel has great potential in applications of self-healing electronic device such as biosensors, electronic skin, wearable electronics, and so on. To evaluate the performance of the strain sensor, we realized the self-healing piezoresistive strain sensor using the SWCNT/hydrogel as conductor, and Scotch permanent clear mounting tape (VHB 4010, 3 m) as elastomeric substrates and encapsulant, as shown in Figure 3a. The high stretchability of both SWCNT/hydrogel and VHB tape allowed the self-healing strain sensor to remain intact up to 1000% strain, the highest value for electronic strain sensor so far, to the best of our knowledge.43-45 The excellent performances of the device are derived from all parts of the device or their coordination with each other. Although the SWCNT/hydrogel itself could not be recovered to the initial state under extreme strain conditions, it can work well when attached to the VHB tape. A strain sensor using the hydrogel without the electronic conducting component (SWCNT) was also prepared on the elastic substrate with the same parameters for comparison. Relative resistance changes versus strains are shown in Figure 3b. The relative resistance change increases with increasing tensile strain. A relative resistance change [(R −R0)/R0 = ΔR/R0, R0 is the resistance at 0% strain, R is the resistance under stretch] of 1514% was observed at 1000% strain for SWCNT/hydrogel, the sensitivity is nearly three times higher than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor (533%). The large resistance change is highly desired for strain sensing applications, which is prerequisite for high sensitivity. Moreover, the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor also showed reproducible and reliable responses to the small strain from 2% to 100% (Figure S4, Supporting Information). These results indicate that the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor can work well from small strain to extreme strain. There are two aspects leading to the piezoresistive effects of SWCNT/hydrogel: one is the intrinsic piezoresistivity of the hydrogel, the other is the change of the contact conditions of SWCNT for electron conduction, such as contact area, loss of contacts and spacing variations upon stretching, and so on. The electrical conductivity of hydrogel without electronic conductor comes from ions conductivity (such as Na+, H+ in the hydrogel).26, 32 In addition, the relative resistance changes versus strains of the strain sensor can fit into a parabolic equation y = Aε2 + Bε + C, where y is the relative resistance changes and ε is the tensile strain.23, 46 There is no relative resistance change when there is no strain applied to the sensor, so C is zero in the equation. Moreover, the value A can be defined as the sensitivity factor. Larger A value leads to more relative resistance changes, corresponding to higher sensitivity in the sensor. Hence, the sensitivity of the strain sensor can be quantified by the equation in Figure 3b. It can be seen that the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor possesses a larger A than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor. Therefore, the sensitivity of the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor is higher than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor, which is consistent with the experimental data. Figure S5 (Supporting Information) shows the photographs of the SWCNT/hydrogel based self-healing strain sensor stretched to different strains. Gauge factor represents the sensitivity of the sensors. Usually, brittle or poorly stretchable conductive materials have higher gauge factor. However, these materials do not possess or only sustain small stretchability. A relatively small strain could result in an irreversible fracture and lead to an infinite gauge factor. In the cases that high stretchability is required, the gauge factor of SWCNT/hydrogel was 0.24 at 100% strain and increased to 1.51 at 1000% strain (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The gauge factor is higher than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor (from 0.09 at 100% strain to 0.53 at 1000% strain), and other piezoresistive electronic strain sensor (0.06 at 200% strain)8 and capacitive soft strain sensors based on ionic conductor (0.348 ± 0.11 at 700% strain).20 Although some strain sensors exhibit much higher gauge factors, the poor stretchability and lack of self-healing capability restrict their applications under rigorous mechanical deformations.47-49 The responses of the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor for other types of deformation such as flexion and twist which are related to human body movements were also tested. Figure 3c displays the resistance change as a function of flexion angle for the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor. When the sensor was flexed, tensile stress built up at the outer curvature and compressive force built at the inner curvature. The conductive SWCNTs are separated from one another at the outer curvature and approached closer to one another at the inner curvature. However, the separated SWCNT played a dominant role for the device, thereby the resistance increased with increasing flexion angle. It can be seen that the resistance increased to 118% from its original value with bending angle increasing from 0° to 150°. When the strain sensor was twisted, the resistance changes versus twist angle still obeys the flexion parabolic equation within the twist angle of less than 540° as shown in the Figure 3d. However, the conductive SWCNT will be separated from one another around the twist point under larger twist angle (more than 540°), hence, the resistance of the device rapidly increases with increasing twist angle that detaches the SWCNT contacts or entanglements. The sensor responds to the twist angle with a good sensitivity, the resistance increases to 457% from the value of the untwisted state after two revolutions (720°) as shown in Figure 3d. The stability of the sensor was also investigated by repeatedly applying 700% stretching strain to the sensor and the resistance was measured at the released state (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The resistance of the sensor remains almost constant with minor fluctuations within 10% within the first 700 cycles strain test (between 0% to 700% strain). However, the largest resistance fluctuations were observed after 700 cycles due to partial water evaporation of the hydrogel during the long-term cycles. The loss of water from hydrogels might become significant in long-term cycles, which can be reduced by an appropriate encapsulation. Finding ideal packaging materials and technology for long lifetimes is a large undertaking beyond the scope of this paper. We suggest that SWCNT/hydrogel with 1000% stretchability is a superior candidate for strain sensing applications, considering the fast self-healing property and significantly improved piezoresistive responses compared to the hydrogel without electronic conductor counterparts. The excellent sensing performances were not only observed in SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor, but could also be achieved on graphene/hydrogel based strain sensor and silver nanowire/hydrogel based strain sensor (Figure S8 and Figure S9, Supporting Information). A relative resistance change of 916% and gauge factor of 0.92 were observed at 1000% strain for graphene/hydrogel. The silver nanowire/hydrogel based strain sensor exhibits high relative resistance change of 2249% and gauge factor of 2.25 at 1000% strain. However, the silver nanowire/hydrogel based strain sensor is not stable due to the easy oxidation of silver nanowires in water and air. The results indicate that the outstanding sensor performance can be obtained on various electronic conductor/hydrogel based strain sensors. The self-healing SWCNT/hydrogel is promising material platform for wearable strain sensor. For demonstration, the SWCNT/hydrogel based sensor was mounted on the white cotton glove, garment, or directly attached on the skin to detect the bending and stretching of the human body, such as finger knuckle, knee joint, neck and elbow joint. Figure 4a shows the motion detection for the index finger. We checked the response behaviors of the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor when the fingers were repeatedly bent at a frequency of 1 Hz. It can be seen that the sensor responded to the motion of the finger rapidly and repeatedly. The background noise is corresponding to the slight trembling of the finger that can be detected by the SWCNT/hydrogel strain sensor, indicating the high sensitivity of the sensor. Figure 4b illustrates the detection of knee joint bending, the sensor is stretched when the bending angles are at 79.8°, 92.5°, 122.7°, respectively, and released when straightening the knee, the resistance increases during the bending and recover during the releasing process. It can be seen that the resistance of the sensor increased as the bending angle increased. Moreover, the sensor is capable of distinguishing the different bending angles of the knee. When the knee was held at a certain angle, the resistance of SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor remained at a constant value and returned to the original value after straightening the knee. Furthermore, when the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor was used to further monitor other human-motion such as neck bending and elbow bending, sharp and rapid responses were also observed as shown in Figure 4c,d, respectively. Although a slight drift is noticed in these responses, the sensor exhibited good stability and repeatability in the signal. The hysteresis of the sensor in the response could lead to the signal drift. Figure S10 (Supporting Information) depicts the relative resistance changes of 1000% and 100% strain under stretching–releasing cycles, significant hysteresis is observed during the 1000% stretching–releasing cycling. The hysteresis is caused by rearrangement of the CNT in the hydrogel matrix and the considerable hysteresis of VHB tape. However, even in this case, the original resistance of the sensor is almost fully recovered after releasing it from strain and the hysteresis is negligible within 100% strain. Moreover, the sensor also has important advantages of low creep and fast response. As seen in Figure S11 (Supporting Information), a step strain of 100% was imposed within 1 s, revealing a percent overshoot and creep recovery time of 7.4% and 0.7 s, respectively, which can be attributed to the excellent self-healing property of the conductive SWCNT/hydrogel. The differences in the degree of muscle movements could lead to a slight drift. In order to prove this, the response behavior of the sensor was also investigated by repeatedly applying 100% stretching strain to the sensor as shown in Figure S12 (Supporting Information). It can be seen that the sensor exhibits a negligible drift under the constant strain. These results demonstrate that our strain sensors can be used as human motion sensor and have the potential application in a wide range of stretchable devices. In summary, the present work first demonstrated the extremely stretchable self-healing strain sensors based on various repeatable self-healing conductive hydrogels such as SWCNT, graphene, and silver nanowire/hydrogel under ambient conditions. The conductive SWCNT/hydrogel exhibits fast electrical healing speed (within 3.2 s) and high self-healing efficiency (98 ± 0.8%). The strain sensor is capable of sustaining severe elastic deformation (up to 1000%) with high gauge factor of 1.51. After being stretched to 700% strain for 1000 cycles, no significant change was observed in the intrinsic properties of the strain sensor. The electrical resistance can effectively recover by self-healing of the conductive SWCNT/hydrogel. Furthermore, the strain sensor could effectively monitor and distinguish multifarious human motion when used as wearable strain sensor. We found that the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensors have good response, stability, and repeatability of the signal during the human motion detection measurements. We believe that our extremely stretchable self-healing strain sensor could find a wide range of applications in robotics, sports, health monitoring, and medical treatments.

A new trimethylaluminum vapor-based crosslinking method to render the nanocrystal films insoluble is applied. The resulting near-complete nanocrystal film coverage, coupled with the natural confinement of injected charges within the perovskite crystals, facilitates electron–hole capture and give rise to a remarkable electroluminescence yield of 5.7%. Metal-halide perovskite semiconductors have attracted significant research interest, due to a combination of low-cost solution processability and remarkable performance in optoelectronic devices.1, 2 In 2014, we demonstrated infrared and visible electroluminescence in methylammonium lead halide perovskites, using a charge-confined diode structure to achieve effective radiative recombination.2-4 However, the use of methylammonium halide, which is a chemical combination of gaseous methylamine and hydrogen halide, necessarily limits the thermal stability of these perovskite devices. Replacing methylammonium with inorganic cesium offers the perovskite extra thermal stability up to its melting at ≈500 °C, but makes it more intractable toward solution processing.5 Recently, Protesescu et al. demonstrated the synthesis of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals,6 following the traditional approaches of growing and stabilizing semiconductor particles in the presence of aliphatic ligands.7 These perovskite nanocrystals are highly luminescent and emit over the full visible range, making them ideal candidates for luminescent display applications.6 The synthetic steps are generally straightforward, and the easy control of halide content allows the perovskite bandgaps to be tailored, both by chemical compositions as well as by quantum size effects. So far, perovskite nanocrystals are shown to have color-pure emission, close to unity photoluminescence yield and low lasing thresholds.8 These nanocrystals were also attempted in light-emitting devices, but efficiencies remain modest at 0.12%.9 Here, we show the preparation of highly efficient perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLED) using solution-processed nanocrystals. We apply a new trimethylaluminum (TMA) vapor-based crosslinking method to render the nanocrystal films insoluble, thereby allowing the deposition of subsequent charge-injection layers without the need for orthogonal solvents. The resulting near-complete nanocrystal film coverage, coupled with the natural confinement of injected charges within the perovskite crystals, facilitate electron–hole capture and give rise to a remarkable electroluminescence yield of 5.7%. Figure 1a shows the device architecture of our perovskite nanocrystal light-emitting diode, and Figure 1b shows the energy-level diagram of the materials within the device stack. Here, our electron-injection layer comprises a film of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals, directly deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate.4 The cesium lead halide nanocrystals were solution-coated onto the ZnO film as the emissive layer. Due to the presence of aliphatic ligands on the nanocrystals, the perovskite film remains soluble to organic solvents, which limits the deposition of subsequent charge-injection layers using solution methods. We employed a new TMA vapor-phase crosslinking technique to fix the nanocrystal film in place, thereby enabling us to solution-cast a layer of TFB polymer (poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine)]) above without washing the nanocrystals off. TFB serves primarily as a hole-injection and electron-blocking layer. A thin, high work-function molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) interlayer and silver electrode were vacuum-thermal evaporated to complete the device. As shown in Figure 1c,d, our perovskite nanocrystal devices show saturated and color-pure emission. We control the perovskite bandgap, primarily by tailoring the halide composition, and achieve electroluminescence across a wide range of the visible spectrum. Our red, orange, green, and blue devices emit at wavelengths of 698, 619, 523, and 480 nm, respectively. All devices exhibit narrow-width emission, with their full-width at half maxima (FWHM) in the range of 17–31 nm. The red and green LEDs were made, respectively, from the pure iodide and pure bromide perovskites, while the orange and blue LEDs were made from mixed-halide perovskites, with CsPbI2.25Br0.75 and CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5 compositions, respectively. The crosslinking of the perovskite nanocrystals was critical toward the realization of our device structure. Traditionally, nanocrystals have been crosslinked, or made insoluble, using ligand exchange techniques, where shorter-chain bi-functionalized organic ligands (e.g., diamines or dithiols) were applied to replace the longer-chain oleyl ligands.11 However, the replacement with smaller ligands often creates cracks and gaps within the nanocrystal film, which could lead to electrical shunts and reduced device performance.12 Closer packing of the nanocrystals could also lead to the self-quenching of the nanocrystals and a lower photoluminescence yield,13 often caused by a more effective Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET) to non-radiative sites.14 Here, crosslinking is achieved by exposing the perovskite nanocrystal film to short pulses of TMA vapor within an enclosed vacuum chamber at room temperature, followed by standing the treated film in ambient air. This creates a well-connected network of hydroxide-terminated aluminum oxide that links the nanocrystals together, hence rendering them insoluble. This vapor-phase technique does not involve ligand exchange processes, and is therefore useful in crosslinking the nanocrystals without altering the original crystal arrangements, thereby allowing much of the film's original structural and electronic properties to be preserved. The photoluminescence spectra of the nanocrystals also remain unchanged after the TMA treatment, hence confirming that the crosslinking has no effect on their optical bandgap. (Note that we use a slightly modified TMA treatment procedure for the blue-emitting nanocrystals—see Figure S1, Supporting Information.) In order to investigate the effectiveness of crosslinking, we varied the exposure of the perovskite nanocrystals to different pulse durations of TMA vapor, and measured the nanocrystal retention upon washing with toluene. The crystal retention ratio was determined using UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 2a, the crosslinking was remarkably rapid even at room temperature, and a near complete retention of nanocrystals was achieved in less than 0.5 s of TMA exposure. The inset scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show a significant wash-off for the non-crosslinked nanocrystals, while the TMA-treated nanocrystals were completely retained after washing. Detailed SEM images and large area scans of the nanocrystal films, upon washing with different organic solvents, are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). Interestingly, we observe a corresponding increase in the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 with TMA treatment, but a decrease in the case of CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5 (see Figure 2b). This PL enhancement is particularly remarkable for the CsPbI3 nanocrystals, raising its PL by more than a factor of 3, from ≈25% in the untreated film to ≈85% in the TMA-treated film. We note that this is possibly one of the highest PLQEs achieved in a non-core–shell structured nanocrystal thin film. In an attempt to unravel the origins of the PL enhancement, we took high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Figure 2c) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images (Figure 2d) of the CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals before and after the TMA treatment, and further analyzed the distribution of main elements within the samples using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectrum imaging (Figure 2e). The nanocrystals show an average size of 19 nm (see Figure S3, Supporting Information), which points to minimal quantum confinement in their electronic bandgap.6 We analyzed the spacing distribution between the nanocrystals in the HRTEM images, and found the average crystal spacing to increase from 1.6 to 1.9 nm upon TMA treatment. We note that a spacing of 1.6 nm between the crystals represents ≈0.55 ligand attachment per unit cell of the perovskite lattice. The spacing distribution analysis is shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information) and further TEM images of CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). By analyzing the EELS spectrum image using a combination of principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and curve-fitting quantification, we were able to map out the distribution of elements, and precisely identify the higher concentrations of aluminum and oxygen elements within the sub-2 nm gaps between the perovskite nanocrystals (Figure 2e). This indicates that the TMA treatment has successfully created an alumina network that covers all areas surrounding and in-between the nanocrystals. The intercalation of alumina among the ligands, therefore, accounts for the small increase in the crystal spacing. While this 0.3 nm increase in spacing may lead to a smaller degree of PL quenching by FRET, it is unlikely to fully account for the threefold enhancement in PL yield. The changes in PL are therefore likely to be chemical in nature, where the introduction of TMA chemically passivates the nanocrystal surface and leads to a reduction in PL-quenching defects.15 To further verify that the aluminum is incorporated between the crystal spacing and not just above the nanocrystal film, we measured the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the sample as a function of film depth, and found aluminum to be quite evenly distributed throughout the entire nanocrystal film thickness (see XPS depth profile in Figure S5, Supporting Information). To elucidate the chemical crosslinking mechanism, we measured the infrared (IR) transmittance spectra of the nanocrystal samples before and after the TMA treatment. For comparison, we also measured the IR spectra of the organic ligands, and plotted them on the same graph in Figure 3a. Three distinct changes could be observed in the IR spectra following the TMA treatment. i) A broad peak centered around 3450 cm−1 is produced in all the TMA-treated samples, signally the presence of O–H stretch. This confirms hydroxide surface terminations as expected for an AlOx network, and the role of ambient water in the crosslinking process. ii) Another broad peak appears around 630 cm−1, and this is characteristic of vibrational modes in alumina.16 iii) A strong and sharp band appears at 1576 cm−1 (for samples containing oleic acid), which can be assigned to weakened C=O stretching. This is particularly clear in the case of TMA-treated oleic acid. It is likely that the bonding of the carboxylate group to the strongly Lewis acidic aluminum causes the C=O bond to be weakened, thereby giving a lower than usual stretching frequency. Interestingly, the C=O stretching band does not appear in the pristine nanocrystal samples, but only emerges after TMA treatment. This is likely to be due to the coordination of the carboxylate group to the nanocrystals, thereby diminishing its oscillator strength. With this information, we propose a reaction mechanism for the cross-linking process as shown in Figure 3b. The introduction of TMA coordinates and reacts with the carboxylate and amino groups of the ligands, adjacent to the nanocrystals. The subsequent exposure to ambient moisture hydrolyzes the remaining methyl-aluminum to give a network of alumina and aluminum hydroxide that are covalently bonded to the ligands. It is likely that the alumina that is formed next to the crystal surface successfully passivates the surface defects, thereby enhancing the crystals' photoluminescence yield. The strongly reactive TMA appears to be benign toward the iodide and bromide perovskites, but causes some level of damage to the chloride perovskites, hence resulting in a degradation of PL in the latter. To further verify the role of ligands in this crosslinking process, we attempted to wash off TMA-treated oleic acid and oleylamine (i.e., no nanocrystals) with toluene. We show in Figure S6 (Supporting Information) that the ligands were crosslinked and insoluble upon TMA treatment, hence indicating that many of the ligands are chemically incorporated into the alumina network across the nanocrystal film. In order to prove the generality of our crosslinking technique, we treated thin films of CdSe and PbS nanocrystals with TMA, and demonstrate them to be insoluble to organic solvents upon treatment (see Figure S7, Supporting Information). The TMA crosslinking method has enabled us to make high-performance light-emitting devices using these nanocrystalline lead halide perovskites. Figure 4a–d shows the detailed device characteristics of our perovskite nanocrystal LEDs. High luminance levels of 2335 and 1559 cd m−2 were achieved in our green and orange-emitting devices, respectively, at current densities of 831 and 852 mA cm−2. As shown in Figure 4b, charge injection turns on efficiently close to the bandgap voltage of the perovskite. To demonstrate the importance of our crosslinking method, we plotted the current–voltage characteristics of the non-TMA-treated CsPbI3 device, and show that the current density is more than an order of magnitude higher than the crosslinked counterpart, even at similar or lower luminance levels. This is a clear indication of current leakage,3 which is a result of voids created from the wash-off of the perovskite nanocrystals. We achieved remarkable external quantum efficiencies (EQE), as high as 5.7%, in the crosslinked red-emitting CsPbI3 device, more than an order of magnitude higher than the non-crosslinked device (see Figure 4c) and a factor of 50 higher than the previous report.9 Correcting for out-coupling losses,17 this would be equivalent to an internal quantum efficiency of ≈26%. We note that our CsPbI3 device emits at 698 nm, close to the edge of human-eye sensitivity, and therefore gives only a modest luminance level of 206 cd m−2 at a current density of 755 mA cm−2. We observed that the EQE of the nanocrystal devices decrease generally with the widening of the perovskite bandgap. This is in line with the trends of a lower PLQE in our green and blue-emitting materials (see Figure 2b). The less-ideal charge injection into larger bandgap perovskites could also result in the lower device efficiencies. Figure 4d gives a summary of the key performance parameters of our nanocrystal LEDs. During our investigation of the mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbI2.25Br0.75 and CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5), we noticed that their emission red-shifts reversibly during device operation, and return slowly toward their original state after resting (see Figure S8, Supporting Information). This emission shift is not observed in the pure-halide samples. This may be related to previous observations on photoluminescence shifts in mixed-halide perovskites upon photoexcitation, which was suggested to be due to phase segregation into purer halide phases.18 We note that our films consist of spatially separated nanocrystals, and any phase segregation or halide rearrangements could therefore occur only within a small domain of less than 20 nm. We further show in Figure S9 (Supporting Information) that the EL shifts are completely consistent with the PL shifts, thereby confirming that these shifts are a result of intrinsic changes within the perovskites, and not due to a change in the device charge-injection properties during operation. In view of the emission shifts in mixed-halide systems, bandgap tuning of pure-halide perovskites via quantum size effect may emerge as the more successful strategy for consumer display applications, where stringent requirements on emission stability are demanded. We have now successfully departed from the traditional core–shell nanocrystal approach, and shown that highly efficient electroluminescence could be realized in semiconductor nanocrystals using a simple TMA crosslinking technique. The remarkable ability of alumina to double as a surface passivating agent further makes the TMA treatment an attractive technique for the fabrication of quantum-dot optoelectronic devices. Indeed, given their intensely luminescent properties, versatile color tuning, coupled with an enhanced thermal stability, these all-inorganic lead halide perovskites may quickly emerge as strong contenders in the color display industry. Materials: TFB was provided by Cambridge Display Technology (CDT) and was used as received. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, and were used as received. Synthesis of CsPbX3 (X =Cl, Br, I) Nanocrystals: Perovskite nanocrystals were synthesized using previously reported procedures.6 Cs2CO3 (0.814g, 99.9%) was loaded into 100 mL three-neck flask along with octadecene (ODE) (30 mL, 90%) and oleic acid (OA) (2.5 mL, 90%), and the mixture was dried for 2 h at 120 °C under N2. The solution temperature was then lowered to 100 °C. ODE (75 mL), oleylamine (OLA) (7.5 mL, 90%), and dried OA (7.5 mL) and PbX2 (2.82 mmol) such as PbI2 (1.26 g, 99.99%), PbBr2 (1.035 g, 99.99%), PbCl2 (0.675g, 99.99%), or their mixtures were loaded into a 250 mL three-neck flask and dried under vacuum for 2 h at 120 °C. After complete solubilization of the PbX2 salt, the temperature was raised to 170 °C and the Cs-oleate solution (6.0 mL, 0.125 m in ODE, prepared as described above) was quickly injected. After 10 s, the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice-water bath. For CsPbCl3 synthesis, 1 mL of trioctylphosphine (TOP) (97%) was added to solubilize PbCl2. The nanocrystals were precipitated from solution by the addition of equal volume anhydrous butanol (BuOH) (99%) (ODE:BuOH = 1:1 by volume). After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the nanocrystals were redispersed in anhydrous hexane (99%) and precipitated again with the addition of BuOH (hexane:BuOH = 1:1 by volume). These were redispersed in hexane. The nanocrystal dispersion was filtered through a 0.2 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter and diluted to 10 mg mL−1 in hexane before use. Synthesis of ZnO Nanocrystals: Colloidal ZnO nanocrystals were synthesized by a solution-precipitation process according to previously reported procedures.19 Typically, zinc acetate dihydrate (329 mg) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (0.5 m) by stirring at room temperature. A solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) (453 mg) in ethanol (5 mL) was then added dropwise within 5 min. After 2 h, the product mixture was decanted and washed twice with ethyl acetate and ethanol. Ethanol (6 mL) was added to disperse the precipitate and produce a colloidal ZnO nanocrystal dispersion with a concentration of ≈7 mg mL−1. The dispersion was filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter before use. Crosslinking of Perovskite Nanocrystals: A BENEQ TFS20 atomic layer deposition (ALD) system was used for the vapor-phase crosslinking treatment. High-purity TMA was purchased from SAFC Hitech. The deposition temperature was set at 18 ± 1 °C, which is also the typical ambient room temperature. The reactor chamber was pumped down below 0.2 mbar before starting the process. TMA was applied in short pulses at a partial pressure of ≈0.01 mbar. The dosage of TMA was controlled by varying the total length of TMA pulses between 0.25 and 20 s. The duration of each pulse was limited to 1 s, hence a 10 s dosage is, for instance, achieved with 10 × 1 s pulses. LED Device Fabrication: A 7 mg mL−1 dispersion of ZnO nanocrystals in ethanol was spin-coated onto an ITO-coated glass substrate at 1500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox to give a 15 nm film. A 10 mg mL−1 perovskite nanocrystal dispersion in hexane was spin-coated at 1000–2000 rpm for 20 s in air to give a 30–50 nm film. The films were allowed to dry in air for ≈10 min, and were transferred into the ALD chamber for crosslinking treatment. Following the crosslinking step, a solution of TFB in toluene (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite nanocrystals at 2000 rpm for 30 s in the glovebox to give a 60 nm thin film. MoO3 (5 nm) and Ag (80 nm) metal layers were deposited by thermal evaporation in a high vacuum of below 5 × 10−6 mbar. The devices were encapsulated by UV-epoxy. LED Characterization: Current versus voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. The photon flux was measured simultaneously using a calibrated silicon photodiode centered over the light-emitting pixel. Luminance in cd m−2 was calculated based on the emission spectrum of the LED, weighted against the standard luminosity function and on the known spectral response of the silicon photodiode. The external quantum efficiency was calculated assuming a Lambertian emission profile. Electroluminescence spectra were measured using a Labsphere CDS-610 spectrometer. Optical Characterization: In the PL measurements, the nanocrystal films were placed in a nitrogen-flushed integrating sphere and were photoexcited using a 405 nm continuous-wave laser (1.5 mW). The laser and the emission signals were measured and quantified using a calibrated Andor iDus DU490A InGaAs detector for the determination of PL quantum efficiency. UV–visible absorption of the nanocrystal films was measured using an HP 8453 spectrometer. Samples were prepared on fused-silica substrate, using same processing parameters as in device fabrication. FTIR Measurements: Mid-IR FTIR data were measured by an Agilent Technologies Cary 600 Series FTIR spectrometer. Nanocrystals were spin-coated onto a KBr substrate, and measured in the wavenumber range of 5000–500 cm−1. Electron Microscopy: TEM characterization was carried out on close-packed CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that were drop-cast on thin TEM carbon grids. The TEM samples were analyzed in an FEI Tecnai Osiris TEM/STEM 80-200 microscope operated at 200 kV. The HAADF-STEM images were acquired using a Fischione detector. The EELS spectra were acquired using a Gatan Enfinium ER 977 spectrometer equipped with DualEELS. Core-loss and low-loss spectra were acquired quasi-simultaneously over different regions of the specimen, using a 2 nm pixel size and a dispersion of 1 eV per channel. The dwell time was 0.2 s for core-loss spectra and 10 μs for low-loss spectra. Convergence and collection angles were 8.5 and 34 mrad, respectively. The elemental maps were obtained by weighted PCA and ICA.20 The quantification by curve fitting of the ICA results was performed using Hartree–Slater cross sections. All the EELS analysis was performed using the open source software package HyperSpy.21 SEM images were acquired using the in-lens detector in a LEO 1550 system. The acceleration voltage was set at 10 kV. This work was supported by the EPSRC [Grant Nos. EP/M005143/1, EP/J017361/1, and EP/G037221/1]. G.L. thanks Gates Cambridge Trust for funding.

Drawing conclusions about the influence of the components and curing conditions on the mechanical properties of the subsequently formed insoluble networks is challenging. Therefore, an in situ observation of chemical and mechanical characteristics during the photopolymerization reaction is desired. By coupling of an infrared spectrometer with a photorheometer, a broad spectrum of different photopolymerizable formulations can be analyzed during the curing reaction. The rheological information (i.e., time to gelation, final modulus, shrinkage force) can be derived from a parallel plate rheometer equipped with a UV- and IR-translucent window (glass for NIR and CaF2 window for MIR). Chemical information (i.e., conversion at the gel point and final conversion) is gained by monitoring the decrease of the corresponding IR-peak for the reactive monomer unit (e.g., C═C double bond peak for (meth)acrylates, H-S thiol and C═C double bond peak in thiol-ene systems, C-O epoxy peak for epoxy resins). Depending on the relative concentration of reactive functional groups in the sample volume and the intensity of the IR signal, the conversion can be monitored in the near-infrared region (e.g., acrylate double bonds, epoxy groups) or the MIR region (e.g., thiol signal). Moreover, an integrated Peltier element and external heating hood enable the characterization of photopolymerization reactions at elevated temperatures, which also widens the window of application to resins that are waxy or solid at ambient conditions. By switching from water to heavy water, the chemical conversion during photopolymerization of hydrogel precursor formulations can also be examined. Moreover, this device could also represent an analytical tool for a variety of thermally and redox initiated systems.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

A key advantage is that the inherent microporosity of these scaffolds provides cells with a more permissive environment than conventional nanoporous hydrogels. Here, norbornene-bearing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based microgels are assembled into 3D cell-instructive scaffolds using a PEG-dithiol linker and thiol-ene click photopolymerization. The bulk modulus of these materials depends primarily on the crosslink density of the microgel building blocks. However, the linker and initiator concentrations used during assembly have significant effects on cell spreading and proliferation when human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are incorporated in the scaffolds. The cell response is also affected by the properties of the modular microgel building blocks, as hMSCs growing in scaffolds assembled from stiff but not soft microgels activate Yes-associated protein signaling. These results indicate that PEG microgel scaffolds assembled via thiol-ene click chemistry can be engineered to provide a cell-instructive 3D milieu, making them a promising 3D platform for tissue engineering.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Polyisocyanide is well known for its distinctive rodlike helical structure and various applications in chiral recognition, enantiomer separation, circularly polarized luminescence, liquid crystallization, and other fields. Although various methods and catalysts for isocyanide polymerization have been reported, the precise synthesis of helical polyisocyanides with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity, and high tacticity remains a formidable challenge. Owing to a limited synthesis strategy, the controlled synthesis of topological polyisocyanides has barely been realized. This Accounts highlights our recent endeavors to explore novel catalysts for the living polymerization of isocyanides. Fortunately, we discovered that alkyne-Pd(II) catalysts could initiate the living polymerization of isocyanides, resulting in helical polyisocyanides with controlled structures, high tacticity, and tunable compositions. These catalysts are applicable to various isocyanide monomers, including alkyl isocyanides, aryl isocyanides, and diisocyanobenzene derivatives. Incorporating chiral bidentate phosphine ligands onto alkyne-Pd(II) complexes formed chiral Pd(II) catalysts, which promoted the asymmetric living polymerization of achiral isocyanide, yielding single left- and right-handed helices with highly optical activities.Using alkyne-Pd(II) catalysts, various topological polyisocyanides have been facilely prepared, including hybrid block copolymers, bottlebrush polymers, core cross-linked star polymers, and organic/inorganic nanoparticles. For instance, various hybrid block polyisocyanides were easily produced by coupling alkyne-Pd(II)-catalyzed living isocyanide polymerization with controlled radical polymerization and ring-opening polymerization (ROP). Combining the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene with Pd(II)-catalyzed isocyanide polymerization, bottlebrush polyisocyanides and core cross-linked star polymers were easily prepared. Pd(II)-catalyzed living polymerization of poly(lactic acid)s with isocyanide termini resulted in densely grafted bottlebrush polyisocyanides with closely packed side chains. Moreover, the surface-initiated living polymerization of isocyanides produced a family of polyisocyanide-grafted organic/inorganic hybrid nanoparticles using nanoparticles with alkyne-Pd(II) catalysts anchored on the surfaces. Surprisingly, the nanoparticles and star polymers with helical polyisocyanide arms performed exceptionally well in terms of chiral recognition and resolution. Incorporated organocatalysts such as proline and prolinol units onto the pendants of optically active helical polyisocyanides, a family of polymer-based chiral organocatalysts, were generated, which showed significantly improved stereoselectivity for the asymmetric Aldol reaction and Michael addition and can be easily recycled.Using a chiral alkyne-Pd(II) catalyst, single-handed helical polyisocyanides bearing naphthalene and pyrene probes were produced from achiral isocyanide monomers. These polymers showed excellent self-sorting properties as revealed using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) investigation and were self-assembled into two-dimensional (2D) smectic nanostructures driven by both helicity and chain length. Incorporating helical poly(phenyl isocyanide) (PPI) onto semiconducting poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) induced the asymmetric assembly of the resulting P3HT-b-PPI copolymers into single-handed cylindrical micelles with controlled dimensions and tunable photoluminescence.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Most commonly, thermo and pH-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) microgels can be fabricated by precipitation polymerization in the presence of the co-monomer acrylic acid (AAc). Traditionally pNIPAm microgels are synthesized in the presence of a crosslinking agent, such as N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), however, microgels can also be synthesized under 'crosslinker free' conditions. The resulting particles have extremely low (<0.5%), core-localized crosslinking resulting from rare chain transfer reactions. AFM nanoindentation of these ultralow crosslinked (ULC) particles indicate that they are soft relative to crosslinked microgels, with a Young's modulus of ∼10 kPa. Furthermore, ULC microgels are highly deformable as indicated by a high degree of spreading on glass surfaces and the ability to translocate through nanopores significantly smaller than the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles. The size and charge of ULCs can be easily modulated by altering reaction conditions, such as temperature, monomer, surfactant and initiator concentrations, and through the addition of co-monomers. Microgels based on the widely utilized, biocompatible polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) can also be synthesized under crosslinker free conditions. Due to their softness and deformability, ULC microgels are a unique base material for a wide variety of biomedical applications including biomaterials for drug delivery and regenerative medicine.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we propose a NIR light free-radical photoinitiator (PI) fabricated by incorporating oxime-ester coumarin functionality on the surface of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The coumarin groups of PI absorb the light emitted from the UCNP core, whereas the oxime ester groups undergo cleavage to form radicals. Upon irradiation at 980 nm, the mobile radicals, formed in a manner similar to that of dandelion seed release, initiate both free-radical and thiol-ene photopolymerizations. The superior efficiency of dandelion-like PIs assisted photopolymerizations can be attributed to the reduction of energy loss and increased local PI concentration due to Förster resonance energy transfer process and confinement effect, respectively. Moreover, the proposed PI system can initiate polymerization under low-power NIR laser and reduces the thermal side effects. The possibility of its potential use in deep curing applications was also demonstrated.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

This paper reports a facile one-pot strategy to immobilize the biocompatible and fluorescent CDs (∼6 nm) into the glucose-imprinted poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-acrylamide-vinylphenylboronic acid) [poly(NIPAM-AAm-VPBA)] copolymer microgels for continuous optical glucose detection. The CDs designed with surface hydroxyl/carboxyl groups can form complexes with the AAm comonomers via hydrogen bonds and, thus, can be easily immobilized into the gel network during the polymerization reaction. The resultant glucose-imprinted hybrid microgels can reversibly swell and shrink in response to the variation of surrounding glucose concentration and correspondingly quench and recover the fluorescence signals of the embedded CDs, converting biochemical signals to optical signals. The highly imprinted hybrid microgels demonstrate much higher sensitivity and selectivity for glucose detection than the nonimprinted hybrid microgels over a clinically relevant range of 0-30 mM at physiological pH and benefited from the synergistic effects of the glucose molecular contour and the geometrical constraint of the binding sites dictated by the glucose imprinting process. The highly stable immobilization of CDs in the gel networks provides the hybrid microgels with excellent optical signal reproducibility after five repeated cycles of addition and dialysis removal of glucose in the bathing medium. In addition, the hybrid microgels show no effect on the cell viability in the tested concentration range of 25-100 μg/mL. The glucose-imprinted poly(NIPAM-AAm-VPBA)-CDs hybrid microgels demonstrate a great promise for a new glucose sensor that can continuously monitor glucose level change.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

It is discovered that photopolymerization reaction between thiol groups modified GO sheets and ene in polymer molecules is critically responsible for the formation of the composite Langmuir films. The film formed by Langmuir assembly of such GO-polymer composite films shows potential to improve the mechanical and chemical properties and promotes the design of various GO-based nanocomposites.

However, the photoactivity of perovskite semiconductors in chemical processes remains relatively unexplored. Here, a general approach toward the synthesis of luminescent perovskite-polymer nanocomposites is reported, whereby perovskite nanocrystals are used as photoinitiators in the polymerization of vinyl monomers. The white-light illumination of a perovskite-monomer mixture triggers a free-radical chain-growth polymerization process, giving rise to high molecular weight polymers of ≈200 kDa. The in situ growth of polymer chains from the perovskite crystal surface allows the formation of individually dispersed nanocrystal cores within an encapsulating polymer matrix, and leads to a significant threefold enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield. This photoluminescence enhancement is attributed to the spatial separation of the perovskite nanocrystals and hence the deactivation of energy transfer to dark crystals. The resulting perovskite-polymer nanocomposites exhibit excellent stability against moisture and are shown to be useful as functional downconversion phosphor films for luminescent displays and lighting.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Given that this process can be performed at high concentrations and under mild reaction conditions, it has the potential to have significant industrial scope. However, given that the majority of industrial (and more specifically biotechnological) formulations contain mixtures of polymers and surfactants, the effect of such surfactants on the PISA process is an important consideration. Thus, to expand the scope of the methodology, the effect of small molecule surfactants on the PISA process, specifically for the preparation of unilamellar vesicles, was investigated. Similar to aqueous photo-PISA findings in the absence of surfactant molecules, the originally targeted vesicular morphology was retained in the presence of varying concentrations of non-ionic surfactants, while a diverse set of lower-order morphologies was observed for ionic surfactants. Interestingly, a critical micelle concentration (CMC)-dependent behavior was detected in the case of zwitterionic detergents. Additionally, tunable size and membrane thickness of vesicles were observed by using different types and concentration of surfactants. Based on these findings, a functional channel-forming membrane protein (OmpF porin), stabilized in aqueous media by surfactant molecules, was able to be directly inserted into the membrane of vesicles during photo-PISA. Our study demonstrates the potential of photo-PISA for the direct formation of protein–polymer complexes and highlights how this method could be used to design biomimicking polymer/surfactant nanoreactors.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

From a practical point of view, the most important feature of this initiating system is its optical characteristics in the visible range with high quantum yield and good solubility properties. This photoinitiating system is applicable for a variety of monomers that can be polymerized via either radical or cationic mechanisms. Various complex macromolecular structures such as telechelic polymers, block and graft copolymers, polymer networks and surface modifications can be simply prepared by using halogenated precursors.

This softness leads to a substantial deformability of such particles at liquid interfaces, which, in turn translates into a complex phase behaviour that can exhibit a phase transition between a non-close packed and a close packed arrangement. Here, we explore how the degree of swellability and deformability - and therefore the softness of the particles - affects the phase behaviour of microgels at the air/water interface upon compression. We use precipitation polymerization to synthesize poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels with similar hydrodynamic radii in the collapsed state and systematically vary the degree of swellability by changing the crosslinking density. We spread these microgels onto the air/water interface of a Langmuir trough and characterize their interfacial properties by surface pressure - area isotherms. Furthermore, we continuously transfer the interfacial microgel monolayer during compression onto a solid substrate, thus encoding the complete phase diagram of the microgels with increasing particle density as a function of the position on the solid substrate. We investigate the microgel arrangement by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy and use image analysis to extract quantitative information on the interparticle distance and degree of order. We find that the phase transition is very sensitive to the crosslinking density and occurs at much lower surface pressures for less deformable particles. The softest microgels do not undergo any phase transition. Instead, the system exhibits pronounced local conformation changes around point defects with local five- and sevenfold symmetries, indicating that the geometry of the assembled structure effectively controls the local pressure experienced by the microgels.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Because of its high resolution and the ability to print living cells, bioprinting has been widely used in artificial tissue and organ generation as well as microscale living cell deposition. In this paper, we present a low-cost stereolithography-based bioprinting system that uses visible light crosslinkable bioinks. This low-cost stereolithography system was built around a commercial projector with a simple water filter to prevent harmful infrared radiation from the projector. The visible light crosslinking was achieved by using a mixture of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel with eosin Y based photoinitiator. Three different concentrations of hydrogel mixtures (10% PEG, 5% PEG + 5% GelMA, and 2.5% PEG + 7.5% GelMA, all w/v) were studied with the presented systems. The mechanical properties and microstructure of the developed bioink were measured and discussed in detail. Several cell-free hydrogel patterns were generated to demonstrate the resolution of the solution. Experimental results with NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells show that this system can produce a highly vertical 3D structure with 50 μm resolution and 85% cell viability for at least five days. The developed system provides a low-cost visible light stereolithography solution and has the potential to be widely used in tissue engineering and bioengineering for microscale cell patterning.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here, a simple and scalable strategy is reported to make injectable and malleable zwitterionic polycarboxybetaine hydrogels, which are superhydrophilic, nonimmunogenic, and completely devoid of nonspecific interactions. When zwitterionic microgels are reconstructed, the combination of covalent crosslinking inside each microgel and supramolecular interactions between them gives the resulting zwitterionic injectable pellet (ZIP) constructs supportive moduli and tunable viscoelasticity. ZIP constructs can be lyophilized to a sterile powder that fully recovers its strength and elasticity upon rehydration, simplifying storage and formulation. The lyophilized powder can be reconstituted with any aqueous suspension of cells or therapeutics, and rapidly and spontaneously self-heals into a homogeneous composite construct. This versatile and highly biocompatible platform material shows great promise for many applications, including as an injectable cell culture scaffold that promotes multipotent stem cell expansion and provides oxidative stress protection.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

High rates of polymerization are observed in all cases, and quantitative monomer conversions can be achieved within 15 min of 405 nm visible light irradiation. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement confirms good control is maintained under aqueous photo-PISA conditions at different [mPEG113-CEPA]/[CEPA] ratios. A morphological phase diagram is constructed for the first time by changing the degree of polymerization (DP) of PHPMA and [mPEG113-CEPA]/[CEPA] ratio. The introduction of homopolymer promotes the formation of higher order morphologies and larger spherical micelles.

Microporous annealed particle scaffolds are introduced to address this trade‐off while maintaining a flowable precursor; however, manufacturing throughput, reproducibility, and flexibility of hydrogel microparticle building blocks are limited, hindering widespread adoption. The scalable high‐throughput production of bioactive microgels for the formation of microporous tissue scaffolds in situ is presented. Using a parallelized step emulsification device, scalable high‐throughput generation of monodisperse microgels is achieved. Crosslinking is initiated downstream of droplet generation using pH modulation via proton acceptors dissolved in the oil phase. This approach enables continuous production of microgels for over 12 h while ensuring highly uniform physicochemical properties. Using this platform, the effects of local matrix stiffness on cell growth orthogonal to scaffold porosity are studied.

In this work, the fabrication of poly(sarcosine)-based diblock copolymer nano-objects with various morphologies via aqueous reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT)-mediated photoinitiated polymerization-induced self-assembly (photo-PISA) is reported. Poly(sarcosine) was first synthesized via ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of sarcosine N-carboxyanhydride, using high-vacuum techniques. A small molecule chain transfer agent (CTA) was then coupled to the active ω-amino chain end of the telechelic polymer for the synthesis of a poly(sarcosine)-based macro-CTA. Controlled chain-extensions of a commercially available water-miscible methacrylate monomer (2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate) were achieved via photo-PISA under mild reaction conditions, using PSar macro-CTA. Upon varying the degree of polymerization and concentration of the core-forming monomer, morphologies evolving from spherical micelles to worm-like micelles and vesicles were accessed, as determined by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, resulting in the construction of a detailed phase diagram. The resistance of both colloidally stable empty vesicles and enzyme-loaded nanoreactors against degradation by a series of proteases was finally assessed. Overall, our findings underline the potential of poly(sarcosine) as an alternative corona-forming polymer to poly(ethylene glycol)-based analogues of PISA assemblies for use in various pharmaceutical and biomedical applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Recently, we reported the use of a latent ruthenium catalyst (HeatMet) in combination with a photosensitizer (2-isopropylthioxanthone) to rapidly photopolymerize dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) formulations upon irradiation with UV light. While this prior work was limited in terms of catalyst and photosensitizer scope, a variety of alternative catalysts and photosensitizers are commercially available that could allow for tuning of thermomechanical properties, potlifes, activation rates, and irradiation wavelengths. Herein, 14 catalysts and 8 photosensitizers are surveyed for the photoROMP of DCPD and the structure–activity relationships of the catalysts examined. Properties relevant to stereolithography additive manufacturing (SLA AM)─potlife, irradiation dose required to gel, conversion─are characterized to develop catalyst and photosensitizer libraries to inform development of SLA AM resin systems. Two optimized catalyst/photosensitizer systems are demonstrated in the rapid SLA printing of complex, multidimensional pDCPD structures with microscale features under ambient conditions.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The size of the micellar nanoparticles was tuned by varying the lengths of hydrophobic and hydrophilic building blocks. Critically, the peptide-functionalized nanoparticles imbued the proapoptotic \"KLA\" peptides (amino acid sequence: KLAKLAKKLAKLAK) with two key properties otherwise not inherent to the sequence: 1) proteolytic resistance compared to the oligopeptide alone; 2) significantly enhanced cell uptake by multivalent display of KLA peptide brushes.

These particles are a prototype for multiparameter bead-based assays employing mass cytometry, a technique in which metal-encoded beads are injected into the plasma torch of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), and the metal ions generated are detected by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. To label the beads, the polymerization reaction was carried out in the presence of various types of small (ca. 5 nm) lanthanide fluoride (LnF3) nanoparticles (e.g., LaF3, CeF3, and TbF3) with polymerizable methacrylate groups on their surface. The type of metal ion and the metal content of the PMMA microbeads could be varied by changing the composition of the reaction medium. An important feature of these microbeads is that acrylic acid groups in the corona are available for covalent attachment of biomolecules. As a proof of concept, FITC–streptavidin (FITC-SAv) was covalently coupled to the surface of a Ln-encoded microbead sample. The number of FITC-SAv binding sites on the beads was determined through three parallel assays involving biotin derivatives. Interaction of the beads with a biotin–tetramethylrhodamine derivative was monitored by fluorescence, whereas interaction of the beads with a biotin-DOTA-Lu derivative was monitored both by ICP-MS and by mass cytometry.

In this work, we report the use of a Norrish type I photoinitiator in conjunction with a RAFT agent to produce a variety of open‐air 3D printable resins that rapidly cure under visible light irradiation. The photoinitiator‐RAFT system polymerizes extremely quickly and provides high 3D printing build rates of up to 9.1 cm h −1 , representing a 7‐fold increase compared to previous RAFT mediated 3D printing systems. 3D printed materials containing thiocarbonylthio groups can be also produced using low concentrations of divinyl comonomers in the initial resins, which has not been successfully achieved using other photocontrolled RAFT polymerization techniques. Interestingly, the inclusion of RAFT agents significantly improves 3D printing resolution compared to formulations without RAFT agent, allowing the fabrication of intricate and complex objects. Spatiotemporally controlled surface modifications of the 3D printed objects from the dormant RAFT agent groups on the material surfaces were also performed under one and two‐pass configurations, inducing multiple successive post‐printing transformations on the same object.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Suitable materials, so called bioinks, have to comply with challenging rheological processing demands and rapidly form a stable hydrogel postprinting in a cytocompatible manner. Gelatin is often adopted for this purpose, usually modified with (meth-)acryloyl functionalities for postfabrication curing by free radical photopolymerization, resulting in a hydrogel that is cross-linked via nondegradable polymer chains of uncontrolled length. The application of allylated gelatin (GelAGE) as a thiol-ene clickable bioink for distinct biofabrication applications is reported. Curing of this system occurs via dimerization and yields a network with flexible properties that offer a wider biofabrication window than (meth-)acryloyl chemistry, and without additional nondegradable components. An in-depth analysis of GelAGE synthesis is conducted, and standard UV-initiation is further compared with a recently described visible-light-initiator system for GelAGE hydrogel formation. It is demonstrated that GelAGE may serve as a platform bioink for several biofabrication technologies by fabricating constructs with high shape fidelity via lithography-based (digital light processing) 3D printing and extrusion-based 3D bioprinting, the latter supporting long-term viability postprinting of encapsulated chondrocytes.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Samples (5 mm diameter; 2, 3 and 4 mm thickness) were made of Universal Composite (UC), Bulk fill Composite (BC) and Flowable Composite (FC). Light curing of specimens was performed with 600, 1000 and 1500 mW/cm2 light intensity and an irradiation time of 20, 40 and 60 s. Vickers microhardness on the top and bottom surfaces of samples was measured. Optimization was carried out via regression analysis using QStatLab software. Photopolymerization process parameters were calculated using a specially designed MatLab software-based algorithm. For all composites, regression models for hardness on top and bottom surfaces of composite layer were established. Layer thickness as well as hardness on top and bottom surfaces of each composite was calculated for 21 curing modes varying with light intensity and irradiation time. It was established that photopolymerization guidelines only of FC manufacturer guarantee the required hardness, while recommended regimes for UC and BC did not satisfy this requirement. Tables, containing recommended light curing regimes, were developed for three composite types, guaranteeing high hardness of composite restoration. They were designed to facilitate work of dentists in dental offices.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, limited to the small luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum), real application examples have rarely been reported. Here, we present a complex system, which show intense circularly polarized ultraviolet luminescence (CPUVL) with large glum value, enabling a chiral UV light triggered enantioselective polymerization. By integrating sensitized triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion and CPL, both visible-to-UV upconversion emission and upconverted circularly polarized ultraviolet luminescence (UC-CPUVL) were obtained in the systems, built of chiral annihilator R(S)-4,12-biphenyl[2,2]paracyclophane (R-/S-TP), and a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer. After dispersing this upconversion system into room-temperature nematic liquid crystal, induced chiral nematic liquid crystal could significantly amplify the glum value (0.19) of UC-CPUVL. Further, the UC-CPUVL emission has been used to trigger the enantioselective photopolymerization of diacetylene.

The considerable light penetration depth of transparent resin leads to over-curing that inevitably cures the residual resin inside flow channels, causing clogs. In this paper, a 3D printing process - in-situ transfer vat photopolymerization is reported to solve this critical over-curing issue in fabricating microfluidic devices. We demonstrate microchannels with high Z-resolution (within 10 μm level) and high accuracy (within 2 μm level) using a general method with no requirements on liquid resins such as reduced transparency nor leads to a reduced fabrication speed. Compared with all other vat photopolymerization-based techniques specialized for microfluidic channel fabrication, our universal approach is compatible with commonly used 405 nm light sources and commercial photocurable resins. The process has been verified by multifunctional devices, including 3D serpentine microfluidic channels, microfluidic valves, and particle sorting devices. This work solves a critical barrier in 3D printing microfluidic channels using the high-speed vat photopolymerization process and broadens the material options. It also significantly advances vat photopolymerization's use in applications requiring small gaps with high accuracy in the Z-direction.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The high originality of this approach is the use of safer compounds in photoinitiating systems (combination flavone derivative/amino acid). 3-Hydroxyflavone can also be used in three-component systems with an iodonium salt and an amine for the cationic polymerization of epoxides upon exposure to near-UV light LED@385 nm. Also interestingly, a charge transfer complex (CTC) between N-phenylglycine NPG and iodonium salt gives also remarkable initiating performance for free radical polymerization of methacrylates upon mild light irradiation conditions (LED@405 nm). High polymerization initiating abilities are found, and high final reactive function conversions are obtained. The use of the new proposed initiating systems as materials for laser write or 3D printing experiments was also especially carried out with the formation of printed green fluorescent photopolymers. This green fluorescence obtained with naturally occurring 3-hydroxyflavone compound can be ascribed to the excited state intramolecular proton transfer ESIPT character. A full picture of the included photochemical mechanisms is given. Remarkably, the 3-hydroxyflavone/amino acid system is also very efficient for photocomposites synthesis with glass fibers (thick samples with good depth of cure) using UV or LED@395 nm conveyor.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Current methods of fabricating origami structures still have several limitations, such as complex material systems or tedious processing steps. We present a simple approach for creating three-dimensional (3D) origami structures by the frontal photopolymerization method, which can be easily implemented by using a commercial projector. The concept of our method is based on the volume shrinkage during photopolymerization. By adding photoabsorbers into the polymer resin, an attenuated light field is created and leads to a nonuniform curing along the thickness direction. The layer directly exposed to light cures faster than the next layer; this nonuniform curing degree leads to nonuniform curing-induced volume shrinkage. This further introduces a nonuniform stress field, which drives the film to bend toward the newly formed side. The degree of bending can be controlled by adjusting the gray scale and the irradiation time, an easy approach for creating origami structures. The behavior is examined both experimentally and theoretically. Two methods are also proposed to create different types of 3D origami structures.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Three compounds were designed and investigated. Good linear evolutions of the molecular weight (Mn) with the conversion were observed. A comparison was provided with a reference iridium (III) complex [Ir(ppy)3 where ppy stands for 2‐phenylpyridine]. The on/off photopolymerization experiments highlight the presence of dormant species and a re‐initiation on demand upon irradiation. This unique re‐initiation property was used for the modification of surfaces (hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties) and surface patterning as well as the synthesis of a block co‐polymer (PMMA‐b‐PBA). A comparative analysis of the behavior of these iron complexes in thermally and photochemically activated polymerization was provided. The chemical mechanisms were studied by steady state photolysis, laser flash photolysis, cyclic voltammetry, luminescence quenching, and electron spin resonance experiments. A catalytic cycle was proposed with two steps: (i) the oxidation of the FeC excited state by an alkyl halide and (ii) the reduction by the oxidized form (FeC°+) by an amine or the macroradicals leading to the regeneration of the catalyst. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Light mediated polymerizations afford simple and facile route to modulate polymerization rate through manipulation of light intensity and by switching on/off the light source. Such mediation has resulted in the synthesis of 3D surfaces with both spatial and temporal control. However, these techniques present a major limitation in terms of oxygen tolerance and require the use of organic solvent. In this contribution, we report an efficient aqueous polymerization system capable of being activated under visible light in the presence of oxygen. We perform aqueous photopolymerization in the presence of water-soluble zinc porphyrin photocatalyst (Zn(II) meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin, ZnTPPS4–) with ascorbic acid as singlet oxygen quencher in both open and closed vessels. Polymers could be prepared without prior deoxygenation with good control over the molecular weight and polydispersity. In addition, polymerization in the presence of air could be achieved with a short inhibition period.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Interestingly, a benzoyl substituent, connected to a carbazole group, could form a benzophenone moiety, which composes a monocomponent Type II benzophenone-carbazole photoinitiator (PI). The synergetic effect of the benzophenone moiety and the amine in the carbazole moiety is expected to produce high performance photoinitiating systems (PISs) for the free radical photopolymerization (FRP). For different substituents, clear effects on the light absorption properties are demonstrated using UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy. Benzophenone-carbazole PIs can initiate the FRP of acrylates alone (monocomponent Type II photoinitiator behavior). In addition, fast polymerization rates and high function conversions of acrylate are observed when an amine and/or an iodonium salt are added in systems. Benzophenone-carbazole PIs have good efficiencies in cationic photopolymerization (CP) upon LED @ 365 nm irradiation in the presence of iodonium salt. In contrast, other PIs without synergetic effect demonstrate unsatisfied photopolymerization profiles in the same conditions. The best PIS identified for the free radical photopolymerization were used in three-dimensional (3D) printing. Steady state photolysis and fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out to investigate the reactivity and the photochemistry and photophysical properties of PIs. The free radicals, generated from the studied PISs, are detected by the electron spin resonance - spin trapping technique. The proposed chemical mechanisms are provided and the structure/reactivity/efficiency relationships are also discussed. All the results showed that the benzophenone-carbazole PIs have a good application potential, and this work provides a rational design route for PI molecules. Remarkably, BPC2-BPC4, C6, C8 were never synthetized before; therefore, 5 of the 8 compounds are completely new.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Polymerization of oligo(ethylene oxide) methyl ether methacrylate (OEOMA) in the presence of CuBr2 catalyst and tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine ligand when irradiated with visible light of 392 nm wavelength at 0.9 mW/cm2 intensity was well controlled. Linear semi-logarithmic kinetic plots and molecular weights increasing with conversion were observed. Polymers of OEOMA were synthesized with low dispersity (Mw/Mn = 1.12) using only 22 ppm of copper catalyst in the presence of excess bromide anions in highly diluted (90% v/v) aqueous media. The effects of copper concentration, salt, and targeted degrees of polymerization were investigated. The polymerization could be directly regulated by external stimulation, i.e., switching the irradiation on/off, with a good retention of chain-end functionality, as proved by clean chain extension of the OEOMA polymers. This new system could enable applications for controlled aqueous radical polymerization due to its low catalyst loading in the absence of any other chemicals.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The development of 3D printing technologies has opened new implementations in rapid prototyping, tooling, dentistry, microfluidics, biomedical devices, tissue engineering, drug delivery, etc. Among different 3D printing techniques, photopolymerization-based process (such as stereolithography and digital light processing) offers flexibility over the final properties of the 3D printed materials (such as optical, chemical, and mechanical properties) using versatile polymer chemistry. The strategy behind the 3D photopolymerization is based on using monomers/oligomers in liquid state (in the presence of photoinitiators) that can be photopolymerized (via radical or cationic mechanism) upon exposure to light source of different wavelengths (depending on the photoinitiator system). An overview of recent evolutions in the field of photopolymerization-based 3D printing and highlights of novel 3D printable photopolymers is provided herein. Challenges that limit the use of conventional photopolymers (i.e., initiation under UV light) together with prospective solutions such as incorporation of photosensitive initiators with red-shifted absorptions are also discussed in detail. This review also spotlights recent progress on the use of controlled living radical photopolymerization techniques (i.e., reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization) in 3D printing, which will pave the way for widespread growth of new generations of 3D materials with living features and possibility for postprinting modifications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Although numerous RAFT-mediated PISA formulations have been successfully explored, inert atmospheres (e.g., nitrogen) are often needed to overcome the oxygen inhibition problem, making this process challenging when polymerizing at low volumes. Moreover, this restriction also reduces the versatility of RAFT-mediated PISA for non-experts. Herein, we report an efficient photoinitiated polymerization-induced self-assembly (photo-PISA) with excellent oxygen tolerance through dual-wavelength type I photoinitiation and photoinduced deoxygenation. The dual-wavelength photo-PISA was explored in water and alcohol/water using 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA), benzyl methacrylate (BzMA), and isobornyl acrylate (IBOA) as core-forming monomers. Polymerization kinetics indicated that dual-wavelength photo-PISA was performed in a batch reactor, flow reactor, and microliter plate with excellent oxygen tolerance. Block copolymer nano-objects with different morphologies (spheres, worms, and vesicles) were successfully prepared by these dual-wavelength photo-PISA techniques.

In this study, aqueous seeded photoinitiated polymerization-induced self-assembly (photo-PISA) is developed for the preparation of cylindrical block copolymer micelles with patchy structures at high solids contents. Cross-linked cylindrical block copolymer micelles prepared by photo-PISA are used as seeds for further chain extension. Surface roughness of the patchy cylindrical block copolymer micelles can be controlled by varying degree of polymerization (DP) of the third block. The obtained patchy cylindrical micelles can be further functionalized via the modification of the third block. Due to the high solids content of patchy cylindrical micelles prepared by seeded photo-PISA (10% w/w or higher), we expect that this study will greatly expand the promise of PISA for the large-scale preparation of cylindrical micelles with well-defined structures.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Near infrared-activated polymerization process, both at the millimeter and sub-micron scales, was investigated. Polymeric macro- and microstructures were fabricated by means of near infrared laser scanning photolithography in the volume of liquid photocurable compositions with focused laser light at 975 nm wavelength. Examination of the polymerization process in the vicinity of the nanoparticles shows strong differences in the rate of polymer shell growth on flat and edge nanoparticle sides.

For example, this lower energy wavelength is safer than UV light that is currently the standard photocuring light source. Also, NIR allows for a deeper light penetration within the material and therefore resulting in a more complete curing of thicker materials containing fillers for access to composites. In this study, we report the use of three-component systems for the NIR photopolymerization of methacrylates: (1) a dye used as a photosensitizer in the NIR range, (2) an iodonium salt as a photoinitiator for the free radical polymerization of the (meth)acrylates, and (3) a phosphine to prevent polymerization inhibition due to the oxygen and to regenerate the dye upon irradiation. Several NIR-absorbing dyes such as a cyanine borate and a silicon–phthalocyanine are presented and studied. Systems using borate dyes resulted in methacrylate monomer conversion over 80% in air. We report three types of irradiation system: low-power LED at 660 and 780 nm as well as a higher power laser diode at 785 nm. The excellent performance reported in this work is due to the crucial role of the added phosphine.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The mechanisms for the photochemical generation of reactive species (i.e., cations and free radicals) produced from photoinitiating systems based on the photoinitiator and an iodonium salt, tris(trimethylsilyl)silane, or an amine, were studied by UV–vis spectroscopy, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, steady‐state photolysis, and electron spin resonance spin‐trapping techniques. The reactive species are particularly efficient for cationic, free radical, hybrid, and thiol‐ene photopolymerizations upon LED exposure. The optimized photoinitiating systems exhibit higher efficiency than those of reference systems (i.e., isopropyl TX‐based photoinitiating systems), especially in the visible range. According to their beneficial features, these photoinitiating systems have considerable potential in photocuring applications. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

Remarkably, some studied naphthalimide derivative based photoinitiating systems (PIS) are even more efficient than the commercial type I photoinitiator bisacylphosphine oxide and the well-known camphorquinone-based systems for cationic or radical photopolymerization. A good efficiency upon a LED projector at 405 nm used in 3D printers is also found: a 3D object can be easily created through an additive process where the final object is constructed by coating down successive layers of material. As another example of their broad potential, a NDP compound enveloped in a cyclodextrin (CD) cavity, leads to a NDP–CD complex which appears as a very efficient water-soluble photoinitiator when combined with methyldiethanol amine to form a hydrogel. The high interest of the present photoinitiator (NDP2) is its very high reactivity, allowing synthesis in water upon LED irradiation as a green way for polymer synthesis.The structure/reactivity/efficiency relationships as well as the photochemical mechanisms associated with the generation of the active species (radicals or cations) are studied by different techniques including steady state photolysis, fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, and electron spin resonance spin-trapping methods.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Fluorescence spectral analyses along with nuclear magnetic resonance studies were performed to determine the rate constants of initiator radical formation and to investigate the mechanisms of polymerization. The obtained polymers were analyzed by spectral and chromatographic methods. Results show that the excited state anthracene undergoes a faster electron transfer reaction with the alkyl halide initiator than the excited state of pyrene. Pyrene excimers, which are formed at higher concentrations, also react with alkyl halides to form initiator radicals. Although pyrene monomers and excimers are acting slower, polymers with higher control over the chain end functionalities and molecular weight characteristics are obtained in comparison to anthracene as sensitizer.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Limited information is available on the intrinsic ability of GO to photocatalytically reduce CO2 as a sole photocatalyst and the activation of light irradiation. In this study, simulated sunlight (SS) and UV-irradiated GO (GOSS and GOUV, respectively) showed enhanced efficiency of photocatalytic reduction of CO2 compared to pristine GO, with a CO yield (4 h) ratio of GOSS/GOUV/GO of 2.7:2.1:1. Here, irradiation plays two important roles: (1) irradiating GO to eliminate CO released under photolysis from photocatalytic reactions and (2) activating GO to create defects and restore the large π-conjugated network, obtaining photolysis-saturated and photoactivated GO for photocatalytic reduction of CO2. The increasing defect density and π conjugation of irradiated GO, as supported by X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy, improve the yield of photoelectrons and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers, as supported by electron spin resonance and transient absorption spectroscopy. This results in an enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of irradiated GO. The higher CO yield of GOSS compared to GOUV indicates that simulated sunlight irradiation is more favorable for GO activation. Our results show that activating GO under irradiation enhances the photocatalytic reduction of CO2.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, it was not observed in fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CDs). Now, photoactivated fluorescence enhancement in fluorine and nitrogen co‐doped carbon dots (F,N‐doped CDs) is presented. At 1.0 atm, the fluorescence intensity of F,N‐doped CDs increases with UV light irradiation (5 s–30 min), accompanied with a blue‐shift of the fluorescence emission from 586 nm to 550 nm. F,N‐doped CDs exhibit photoactivated fluorescence enhancement when exposed to UV under high pressure (0.1 GPa). F,N‐doped CDs show reversible piezochromic behavior while applying increasing pressure (1.0 atm to 9.98 GPa), showing a pressure‐triggered aggregation‐induced emission in the range 1.0 atm–0.65 GPa. The photoactivated CDs with piezochromic fluorescence enhancement broadens the versatility of CDs from ambient to high‐pressure conditions and enhances their anti‐photobleaching.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Yet, the past two decades have seen extensive development of materials that bridge this gap through incorporation of dynamic crosslinks, enabling them to behave as both robust networks and moldable plastics. Although their potential utility is significant, the growth of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) has obscured the line between \"thermoplastic\" and \"thermoset\" and erected a conceptual barrier to the growing number of new researchers entering this discipline. This Perspective aims to both outline the fundamental theory of CANs and provide a critical assessment of their current status. We emphasize throughout that the unique properties of CANs emerge from the network chemistry, and particularly highlight the role that the crosslink exchange mechanism (i.e., dissociative exchange or associative exchange) plays in the resultant material properties under processing conditions. Predominant focus will be on thermally induced dynamic behavior, as the majority of presently employed exchange chemistries rely on thermal stimulus, and it is simple to apply to bulk materials. Lastly, this Perspective aims to identify current issues and address possible solutions for better fundamental understanding within this field.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Currently, natural hydrogels used to support epidermal regeneration are mainly collagen‐ or gelatin‐based, which mimic the natural dermal extracellular matrix but often suffer from insufficient and uncontrollable mechanical and degradation properties. In this study, a photocrosslinkable gelatin (i.e., gelatin methacrylamide (GelMA)) with tunable mechanical, degradation, and biological properties is used to engineer the epidermis for skin tissue engineering applications. The results reveal that the mechanical and degradation properties of the developed hydrogels can be readily modified by varying the hydrogel concentration, with elastic and compressive moduli tuned from a few kPa to a few hundred kPa, and the degradation times varied from a few days to several months. Additionally, hydrogels of all concentrations displayed excellent cell viability (&gt;90%) with increasing cell adhesion and proliferation corresponding to increases in hydrogel concentrations. Furthermore, the hydrogels are found to support keratinocyte growth, differentiation, and stratification into a reconstructed multilayered epidermis with adequate barrier functions. The robust and tunable properties of GelMA hydrogels suggest that the keratinocyte laden hydrogels can be used as epidermal substitutes, wound dressings, or substrates to construct various in vitro skin models.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Inspired by the phenomenon where islands can recruit seabirds for nesting, “cell island” microgels (MGs), that is, growth factor‐loaded methacrylated hyaluronic acid and heparin blend MGs, which can recruit endogenous stem cells and promote chondrogenic differentiation, are constructed using microfluidic technology and photopolymerization processes, followed by non‐covalently binding platelet‐derived growth factor‐BB (PDGF‐BB) and transforming growth factor‐beta3 (TGF‐β3). The loading efficiency of PDGF‐BB and TGF‐β3 are 96% and 91%, respectively. In vitro and in vivo experiments find that the “cell island” MGs can enhance the migratory capacity of cells and recruit them from their niche via releasing PDGF‐BB. Meanwhile, by using hyaluronic acid, the “cell island” MGs provide a suitable microenvironment for cell attachment and spreading. Furthermore, the “cell island” MGs induce chondrogenic differentiation of the recruited cells via releasing TGF‐β3 and present a promising therapeutic effect for osteoarthritis. In sum, this developed “cell island” MG might serve as a temporary “nest site” to allow the migration, adhesion, and differentiation of endogenous stem cells, which can be a promising candidate rather than the conventional cell‐seeded scaffolds for promoting tissue regeneration.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Wound infection can not only hinder healing but it can also lead to serious complications. Injectable wound dressings with biocompatible and antibacterial properties can promote wound healing during skin infections and reduce antibiotic use. Here, we used glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) to modify ε-polylysine (ε-PL) and γ-poly(glutamic acid) (γ-PGA) to produce ε-polylysine-glycidyl methacrylate (ε-PL-GMA) and γ-poly(glutamic acid)-glycidyl methacrylate (γ-PGA-GMA). Subsequently, ε-PL-GMA- and γ-PGA-GMA-based hydrogels were developed through photopolymerization using visible light. The hydrogels were injectable, could rapidly gelatinize, were biocompatible, and showed a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity. The hydrogels also promoted wound healing. The results show that these hydrogels inhibit bacterial infection and shorten the wound healing time of skin defects in Staphylococcus aureus models. This demonstrates that the hydrogels hold potential for clinical antimicrobial and wound healing therapy.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

They are unique systems that are distinctly different from common colloids, such as, e.g., rigid nanoparticles, flexible macromolecules, micelles, or vesicles. The size of the microgel networks is in the range of several micrometers down to nanometers (then sometimes called \"nanogels\"). In a collapsed state, they might resemble hard colloids but they can still contain significant amounts of solvent. When swollen, they are soft and have a fuzzy surface with dangling chains. The presence of cross-links provides structural integrity, in contrast to linear and (hyper)branched polymers. Obviously, the cross-linker content will allow control of whether microgels behave more \"colloidal\" or \"macromolecular\". The combination of being soft and porous while still having a stable structure through the cross-linked network allows for designing microgels that have the same total chemical composition, but different properties due to a different architecture. Microgels based, e.g., on two monomers but have either statistical spatial distribution, or a core-shell or hollow-two-shell morphology will display very different properties. Microgels provide the possibility to introduce chemical functionality at different positions. Combining architectural diversity and compartmentalization of reactive groups enables thus short-range coexistence of otherwise instable combinations of chemical reactivity. The open microgel structure is beneficial for uptake-release purposes of active substances. In addition, the openness allows site-selective integration of active functionalities like reactive groups, charges, or markers by postmodification processes. The unique ability of microgels to retain their colloidal stability and swelling degree both in water and in many organic solvents allows use of different chemistries for the modification of microgel structure. The capability of microgels to adjust both their shape and volume in response to external stimuli (e.g., temperature, ionic strength and composition, pH, electrochemical stimulus, pressure, light) provides the opportunity to reversibly tune their physicochemical properties. From a physics point of view, microgels are particularly intriguing and challenging, since their intraparticle properties are intimately linked to their interparticle behavior. Microgels, which reveal interface activity without necessarily being amphiphilic, develop even more complex behavior when located at fluid or solid interfaces: the sensitivity of microgels to various stimuli allows, e.g., the modulation of emulsion stability, adhesion, sensing, and filtration. Hence, we envision an ever-increasing relevance of microgels in these fields including biomedicine and process technology. In sum, microgels unite properties of very different classes of materials. Microgels can be based on very different (bio)macromolecules such as, e.g., polysaccharides, peptides, or DNA, as well as on synthetic polymers. This Account focuses on synthetic microgels (mainly based on acrylamides); however, the general, fundamental features of microgels are independent of the chemical nature of the building moieties. Microgels allow combining features of chemical functionality, structural integrity, macromolecular architecture, adaptivity, permeability, and deformability in a unique way to include the \"best\" of the colloidal, polymeric, and surfactant worlds. This will open the door for novel applications in very different fields such as, e.g., in sensors, catalysis, and separation technology.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Despite its superior printing quality and manufacturing speed, the development of biodegradable devices by this technique remains challenging. This results from the conflicting viscosity requirements for the printing resins, i.e., low viscosity is required for high‐resolution 3D printing, whereas high viscosity is often needed to provide high mechanical strength. Recently emerging photopolymerization‐based 3D printing techniques, including heat‐assisted digital light processing (DLP) and volumetric printing, have brought new hope to the field. With its tolerance to high viscosity resins, heat‐assisted DLP enables the fabrication of complex, personalizes architectures from biodegradable photopolymers that are not printable by conventional printing techniques. On the other hand, volumetric printing, which abandons the layer‐by‐layer printing principle and thus circumvents the dependence on low viscosity resins, could be highly beneficial for the 3D printing of biodegradable devices. This perspective evaluates the key challenges associated with biodegradable photopolymers used in the 3D printing of medical implants and devices. One focuses on their chemical structures and physical properties and discusses future directions offered by these emerging techniques.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

As an active ingredient of turmeric, it is well-known for its traditional medicinal properties. The therapeutic values include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and anticancer activity with the last being primarily due to inhibition of the transcription factor NF-κB besides affecting several biological pathways to arrest tumor growth and its progression. Curcumin with all these positive qualities has only remained a potential candidate for cancer treatment over the years without seeing any proper usage because of its hydrolytic instability involving the diketo moiety in a cellular medium and its poor bioavailability.The situation has changed considerably in recent years with the observation that curcumin in monoanionic form could be stabilized on binding to a metal ion. The reports from our group and other groups have shown that curcumin in the metal-bound form retains its therapeutic potential. This has opened up new avenues to develop curcumin-based metal complexes as anticancer agents. Zinc(II) complexes of curcumin are shown to be stable in a cellular medium. They display moderate cytotoxicity against prostate cancer and neuroblastoma cell lines. A similar stabilization and cytotoxic effect is reported for (arene)ruthenium(II) complexes of curcumin against a variety of cell lines. The half-sandwich 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphatricyclo-[3.3.1.1]decane (RAPTA)-type ruthenium(II) complexes of curcumin are shown to be promising cytotoxic agents with low micromolar concentrations for a series of cancer cell lines. In a different approach, cobalt(III) complexes of curcumin are used for its cellular delivery in hypoxic tumor cells using intracellular agents that reduce the metal and release curcumin as a cytotoxin.Utilizing the photophysical and photochemical properties of the curcumin dye, we have designed and synthesized photoactive curcumin metal complexes that are used for cellular imaging by fluorescence microscopy and damaging the cancer cells on photoactivation in visible light while being minimally toxic in darkness. In this Account, we have made an attempt to review the current status of the chemistry of metal curcumin complexes and present results from our recent studies on curcumin complexes showing remarkable in vitro photocytotoxicity. The undesirable dark toxicity of the complexes can be reduced with suitable choice of the metal and the ancillary ligands in a ternary structure. The complexes can be directed to specific subcellular organelles. Selectivity by targeting cancer cells over normal cells can be achieved with suitable ligand design. We expect that this methodology is likely to provide an impetus toward developing curcumin-based photochemotherapeutics for anticancer treatment and cure.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, there is still a lack of thorough understanding and direct evidence for the direct Z-scheme charge transfer in these photocatalysts. Herein, a recyclable direct Z-scheme composite film composed of titanium dioxide and cadmium sulfide (TiO2 /CdS) is prepared for high-efficiency photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2 ) reduction. In situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI-XPS) confirms the direct Z-scheme charge-carrier migration pathway in the photocatalytic system. Furthermore, density functional theory simulation identifies the intrinsic cause for the formation of the direct Z-scheme heterojunction between the TiO2 and the CdS. Thanks to the significantly enhanced redox abilities of the charge carriers in the direct Z-scheme system, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of the optimized TiO2 /CdS is 3.5, 5.4, and 6.3 times higher than that of CdS, TiO2 , and commercial TiO2 (P25), respectively, in terms of methane production. This work is a valuable guideline in preparation of highly efficient recyclable nanocomposite for photoconversion applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Herein, a step (S)‐scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is prepared by in situ growth of an inorganic semiconductor firmly on an organic semiconductor. A new pyrene‐based conjugated polymer, pyrene‐ alt ‐triphenylamine (PT), is synthesized via the typical Suzuki–Miyaura reactions, and then employed as a substrate to anchor CdS nanocrystals. The optimized CdS/PT composite, coupling 2 wt% PT with CdS, exhibits a robust H 2 evolution rate of 9.28 mmol h −1 g −1 with continuous release of H 2 bubbles, as well as a high apparent quantum efficiency of 24.3%, which is ≈8 times that of pure CdS. The S‐scheme charge transfer mechanism between PT and CdS, is systematically demonstrated by photoirradiated Kelvin probe measurement and in situ irradiated X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. This work provides a protocol for preparing specific S‐scheme heterojunction photocatalysts on the basis of inorganic/organic coupling.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Remarkably, 1-amino-4-methyl-naphthalene-2-carbonitrile derivatives are highly versatile allowing access to photoinitiating systems for (i) the cationic photopolymerization of epoxide monomers with a ring opening mechanism and vinyl ether monomers with chain growth mechanisms (ii) the free-radical photopolymerization of acrylate monomers, (iii) the photopolymerization of interpenetrated polymer networks (IPNs) based on epoxide and acrylate monomers under air and under laminate in an oxygen-free atmosphere (iv) the thiol-ene photopolymerization processes. Excellent polymerization profiles are obtained during all types of photopolymerization processes. The initiation mechanisms are analyzed through steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry and fluorescence experiments. Moreover, the newly developed bimolecular photoinitiating systems were investigated by applying an additive manufacturing process under visible light sources. Furthermore, vat photopolymerization processes using IPN compositions, which are polymerizable by using new photoinitiating systems, provide high resolution and speeds. For these reasons, new bimolecular photoinitiating systems are promising initiators for photopolymerization-based 3D printing process to fabricate 3D structures.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

CQ /amine/phosphine derivative or CQ /amine/iodonium salt/phosphine derivative combinations were studied. Real‐time Fourier transform IR and photo‐ DSC experiments were used to monitor the polymerization profiles. Remarkably, it was found that the addition of the new phosphine derivative to CQ /amine or CQ /amine/iodonium salt noticeably improved the rate of polymerization and the final conversion in air. A low migration was found for this additive as shown by HPLC experiments in agreement with a copolymerizable behaviour. No additional yellowing of the film was observed. Electron spin resonance spectrometry was used to detect the produced radicals. The overall chemical mechanisms are investigated and discussed. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The S‐scheme heterojunction system has shown great potential in facilitating separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, as well as acquiring strong photoredox ability. Herein, a 0D/2D S‐Scheme heterojunction material involving CeO 2 quantum dots and polymeric carbon nitride (CeO 2 /PCN) is designed and constructed by in situ wet chemistry with subsequent heat treatment. This S‐scheme heterojunction material shows high‐efficiency photocatalytic sterilization rate (88.1 %) towards Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) under visible‐light irradiation ( λ ≥420 nm), which is 2.7 and 8.2 times that of pure CeO 2 (32.2 %) and PCN (10.7 %), respectively. Strong evidence of S‐scheme charge transfer path is verified by theoretical calculations, in situ irradiated X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The photoinitiated polymerization of isobornyl acrylate (IBA) in the presence of 2-(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)-2-methylpropionic acid (CTA) and 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone as a photoinitiator proceeded in a controlled manner, yet more rapidly compared to thermally initiated polymerization. When polylactide-macroCTA (PLA-CTA) was used, PLA-b-PIBA with high molar mass was obtained after several minutes of irradiation at room temperature. We confirmed that microphase separation occurs in the PLA-b-PIBA and that nanoporous PIBA can be derived from the PLA-b-PIBA precursor by selective PLA etching. To fabricate the cross-linked nanoporous polymer, IBA was copolymerized with ethylene glycol diacrylate (EGDA) in the presence of PLA-CTA to produce a cross-linked block polymer precursor consisting of bicontinuous PLA and P(IBA-co-EGDA) microdomains, via polymerization-induced microphase separation. We demonstrated that nanoporous P(IBA-co-EGDA) monoliths and films with 3D continuous pores can be readily obtained via this approach.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Until recently, there were very few living/controlled polymerization techniques which could be activated by visible light. In this contribution, we investigate the photolysis of different thiocarbonylthio compounds, including 4-cyano-4-[(dodecylsulfanylthiocarbonyl)sulfanyl]pentanoic acid (CDTPA), 2-(dodecylthiocarbonothioylthio)-2-methylpropionic acid (DDMAT), 4-cyanopentanoic acid dithiobenzoate (CPADB), and 2-(n-butyltrithiocarbonate) propionic acid (BTPA), under visible lights (typically, 5W) to initiate a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization.

In this paper, we highlight the importance of the thermal stability of the hydrogen-bonded complexes of the protonated monomers. We observed that the glycidyl ether structural motif (and its oxetane analog) is key for the formation of the complexes. Using temperature-controlled Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) with in situ ultraviolet irradiation, we performed a series of real-time FTIR experiments which support the hypothesis that the induction period is due to the thermal stability of the hydrogen-bonded complex. In particular, we focused on the photoinitiated cationic polymerization of bis(1-ethyl(3-oxetanil)methyl) ether (\"di-oxetane\", DOX) for the thermal stability study because it exhibits a prolonged induction period. Furthermore, it was possible to delay the cationic polymerization of DOX without causing autocatalytic polymerization if the temperature is kept lower than 30 °C. This is because the protonated monomer is stable and propagates very slowly at temperatures below 30 °C. On subsequent heating, the hydrogen-bonded complex of DOX loses its thermal stability, and the autocatalytic cationic polymerization of DOX occurs.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Under studied conditions, LED illumination alone had negligible antibacterial effects while photoactivated curcumin exhibited strong bactericidal activities against Escherichia coli . Minimum inhibitory concentration of photosensitized curcumin against E. coli on nutrient agar surface at a concentration of 1.5 × 10 5 cfu/cm 2 was estimated to be 1.60 × 10 −3 M, combined with irradiation of 27.2 J/cm 2 at 465 nm. Bacterial inactivation kinetics could be described by a Weibull model ( R 2 = 0.979–0.999, RMSE = 0.019–0.229). When the treatment was applied on grape surface, the efficiency was lower as compared to that on the agar surface. Photoactivation enhanced quality retention of the samples during storage with significant preservation of vitamin C, color, texture, and reduction of weight losses. Practical applications The study provides an alternative method for food surface decontamination. Inactivation of pathogens and spoilage microorganism by combined visible LED light source and natural photosensitizers minimizes the adverse processing effects on organoleptic and physicochemical quality of the treated foods. The approach could be further optimized, scaled up, and applied in food industries.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Because of the outstanding lithium ion mobility that is readily identifiable in the solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, the flexible cnHSEs demonstrate a relatively high ionic conductivity even at low temperature of −20 °C and up to the maximum of 7.3 × 10–4 S cm–1 at 30 °C. The ionic conductivity herein is higher than that for typical solid polymer electrolytes at the identical temperature. Additionally, the lithium ion transference number is also improved simultaneously up to 0.7 more due to the scavenger effect of silica nanoparticles embedded in the system. Moreover, the cnHSEs show a broad electrochemical stability window, and the fabricated cell comprising Li|cnHSEs|LiFePO4 exhibits a highly reversible electrochemical reaction and stable cycling performance.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we study ultra-low crosslinked poly( N -isopropylacrylamide) microgels (ULC), which can behave like colloids or flexible polymers depending on dimensionality, compression or other external stimuli. Small-angle neutron scattering shows that the structure of the ULC microgels in bulk aqueous solution is characterized by a density profile that decays smoothly from the center to a fuzzy surface. Their phase behavior and rheological properties are those of soft colloids. However, when these microgels are confined at an oil-water interface, their behavior resembles that of flexible macromolecules. Once monolayers of ultra-low crosslinked microgels are compressed, deposited on solid substrate and studied with atomic-force microscopy, a concentration-dependent topography is observed. Depending on the compression, these microgels can behave as flexible polymers, covering the substrate with a uniform film, or as colloidal microgels leading to a monolayer of particles.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In this contribution, we present photoinitiated polymerization-induced self-assembly (photo-PISA) based on aqueous visible light-induced reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)-mediated emulsion polymerization at room temperature. A wide range of morphologies including spheres, worms, and vesicles have been achieved at room temperature by modulating reaction parameters. Additionally, this method enables access to inorganic nanoparticles-loaded vesicles by adding inorganic nanoparticles at the beginning of the polymerization. Finally, an oxygen-tolerant RAFT-mediated emulsion polymerization has been developed, allowing the synthesis of polymer nano-objects at low volumes (e.g., in a 96-well plate). This study is expected to expand the scope of photo-PISA for the preparation of various block copolymer nano-objects in water at room temperature.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

This unique combination of two types of free-radical reaction mechanisms offers a simple way to fabricate various acrylate-based hybrid monoliths. The physical characterization, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis was performed. The results indicated that the monothiol monomers were successfully incorporated into acryl-POSS-based hybrid monoliths. The column efficiencies for alkylbenzenes on the C18-functionalized hybrid monolithic column reached to 60 000-73 500 plates/m at the velocity of 0.33 mm/s in capillary liquid chromatography, which was far higher than that of previously reported POSS-based columns prepared via thermal-initiated free-radical polymerization without adding any thiol monomers. By plotting the plate height (H) of the alkylbenzenes versus the linear velocity (u) of the mobile phase, the results revealed a retention-independent efficient performance of small molecules in the isocratic elution. These results indicated that more homogeneous hybrid monoliths formed via photoinitiated thiol-acrylate polymerization; particularly, the use of the multifunctional cross-linker possibly prevented the generation of gel-like micropores, reducing mass transfer resistance (C-term). Another sulfonate-containing hybrid monolithic column also exhibited hydrophobicity and ion-exchange mechanism, and the dynamic binding capacity was calculated as 71.1 ng/cm (75 μm i.d.).\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Importantly, highly pure worm-like micelles were readily isolated due to the in situ formation of highly viscous gels.

Historically, the ability to locally program the mechanical response of high strain (>30%) liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) has been limited to magnetic or mechanical alignment techniques, which limits spatial resolution. Recently, we reported on the preparation of LCEs capable of 55% strain with spatial control of the mechanical response at scales as small as 0.01 mm2. Here, we report a distinct formulation strategy to realize programmable stimulus-response in LCEs. Photopolymerization of thiol–ene/acrylate formulations yields materials that exhibit large reversible strain up to 150%. The photopolymerization reaction is extremely rapid, reducing preparation time from days to minutes. The mechanical behavior of these materials can be tuned by varying cross-link density. Spatial and hierarchical programming of the director profile is demonstrated, enabling 3-D shape change, including twisting ribbons and localized Gaussian curvature.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Silver nanoparticles were loaded with the vesicles via in situ reduction, which can be used as a catalyst for the reduction of methylene blue (MB) in the presence of NaBH4.

Remarkably, these photoinitiators (noted monofunctional benzophenone‐triphenylamine (MBP‐TPA) and trifunctional benzophenone‐triphenylamine (TBP‐TPA)) are designed and developed for the photopolymerization under light‐emitting diodes (LEDs). Benzoyl substituents connected with triphenylamine moiety contribute to the excellent absorption properties which results in both high final conversions and polymerization rates in free radical photopolymerization (FRP). Remarkably, TBP‐TPA owning trifunctional benzophenone group exhibits a better Type II PI behavior than well‐known 2‐isopropylthioxanthone for photopolymerization under LED@365 and 405 nm irradiation. FRP and cationic photopolymerization of TBP‐TPA‐based systems are applied on 3D printing experiments, and good profiles of the 3D patterns are observed.

Real-time FTIR and photo-DSC photopolymerization experiments with a cycloaliphatic epoxide and vinyl monomers showed surprisingly good reactivity of the bimolecular photoinitiating systems under UV-A, as well as under visible light sources. Steady-state photolysis, fluorescence experiments, theoretical calculations of molecular orbitals, and electrochemical analysis demonstrated photo-redox behavior as well as the ability to form initiating species via photo-reduction or photo-oxidation pathways, respectively. Therefore, the 2-amino-4,6-diphenylpyridine-3-carbonitrile derivatives were also investigated as a type II free-radical photoinitiator with amine. It was confirmed that the 2-amino-4,6-diphenylpyridine-3-carbonitrile derivatives, in combination with different types of additives, e.g., amine as a co-initiator or the presence of onium salt, can act as bimolecular photoinitiating systems for cationic, free-radical, and thiol-ene photopolymerization processes by hydrogen abstraction and/or electron transfer reactions stimulated by either near-UV or visible light irradiation. Finally, the 2-amino-4,6-diphenylpyridine-3-carbonitrile derivatives were selected for 3D printing rapid prototyping experiments. Test objects were successfully printed using purely cationic photosensitive resin, created on a 3D printer with a visible LED light source.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, it was not observed in fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CDs). Now, photoactivated fluorescence enhancement in fluorine and nitrogen co‐doped carbon dots (F,N‐doped CDs) is presented. At 1.0 atm, the fluorescence intensity of F,N‐doped CDs increases with UV light irradiation (5 s–30 min), accompanied with a blue‐shift of the fluorescence emission from 586 nm to 550 nm. F,N‐doped CDs exhibit photoactivated fluorescence enhancement when exposed to UV under high pressure (0.1 GPa). F,N‐doped CDs show reversible piezochromic behavior while applying increasing pressure (1.0 atm to 9.98 GPa), showing a pressure‐triggered aggregation‐induced emission in the range 1.0 atm–0.65 GPa. The photoactivated CDs with piezochromic fluorescence enhancement broadens the versatility of CDs from ambient to high‐pressure conditions and enhances their anti‐photobleaching.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

It typically results in the undesirable physical collapse of fabricated constructs due to impaired cross-linking, and is an issue that generally remains unreported in the literature. In this study, we describe a systematic approach to minimizing oxygen inhibition in photopolymerized gelatin-methacryloyl (Gel-MA)-based hydrogel constructs, by comparing a new visible-light initiating system, Vis + ruthenium (Ru)/sodium persulfate (SPS) to more conventionally adopted ultraviolet (UV) + Irgacure 2959 system. For both systems, increasing photoinitiator concentration and light irradiation intensity successfully reduced oxygen inhibition. However, the UV + I2959 system was detrimental to cells at both high I2959 concentrations and UV light irradiation intensities. The Vis + Ru/SPS system yielded better cell cyto-compatibility, where encapsulated cells remained >85% viable even at high Ru/SPS concentrations and visible-light irradiation intensities for up to 21 days, further highlighting the potential of this system to biofabricate cell-laden constructs with high shape fidelity, cell viability, and metabolic activity.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Herein, we report an enzyme-assisted photoinitiated polymerization-induced self-assembly (photo-PISA) approach to prepare well-defined AB diblock or ABC triblock copolymer nano-objects at room temperature in open vessels and multiwell plates. Kinetic studies indicated that the presence of glucose oxidase (GOx) endowed the polymerizations with excellent oxygen tolerance. Good control was maintained during the enzyme-assisted photo-PISA process. This method facilitates high-throughput PISA, allowing for the construction of a detailed phase diagram in a rather short time. We also demonstrate the potential bio-related application of this method by the successful encapsulation of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) into self-assembled polymer vesicles without compromising protein activities.

Despite a large amount of experimental activities on microgels, a proper theoretical description based on individual particle properties is still missing due to the complexity of the particles. To go one step further, here we propose a novel methodology to assemble realistic microgel particles \"in silico\". We exploit the self-assembly of a binary mixture composed of tetravalent (crosslinkers) and bivalent (monomer beads) patchy particles under spherical confinement in order to produce fully-bonded networks. The resulting structure is then used to generate the initial microgel configuration, which is subsequently simulated with a bead-spring model complemented by a temperature-induced hydrophobic attraction. To validate our assembly protocol we focus on a small microgel test-case and show that we can reproduce the experimental swelling curve by appropriately tuning the confining sphere radius, something that would not be possible with less sophisticated assembly methodologies, e.g. in the case of networks generated from an underlying crystal structure. We further investigate the structure (in reciprocal and real space) and the swelling curves of microgels as a function of temperature, finding that our results are well described by the widely-used fuzzy sphere model. This is a first step toward a realistic modelling of microgel particles, which will pave the way for a careful assessment of their elastic properties and effective interactions.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

It is demonstrated that conducting polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) at low temperatures is crucial for obtaining colloidal stable PGMA-based diblock copolymer nano-objects. Good control is maintained during the photo-PISA process with a high rate of polymerization. The polymerization can be switched between \"ON\" and \"OFF\" in response to visible light. A phase diagram is constructed by varying monomer concentration and degree of polymerization. The PGMA-based diblock copolymer nano-objects can be further cross-linked by using a bifunctional primary amine reagent. Finally, silver nanoparticles are loaded within cross-linked vesicles via in situ reduction, exhibiting good catalytic properties.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Polymer composites provide a higher strengths, easily customizable product properties, flexible manufacturing processes, high resistance to corrosion or erosion, and lower cost. In addition, the additive manufacturing (AM) techniques for polymer composites offer numerous benefits, including higher accuracy, lesser cost, and complexity of fabricated parts. The recent progress in AM processes has paved the way for even a broader range of design flexibilities and materials selection for several industrial sectors, including mechanical, biomedical, filtration, and electrical. However, some challenges remain in additive manufacturing for polymer composites. Vat photopolymerization (VP) processes is an AM technique that provides a benefit of relatively lower cost and higher resolutions; therefore, a comparative review of VP processes for polymers and polymer composites and their applications is presented in this study. This study aims to provide researchers with an updated understanding of the underlying challenges and opportunities.

In the past few years, many encouraging achievements have been made in the research area of graphene‐based semiconductor photocatalysts. Among them, CdS/graphene nanocomposites have attracted extensive attention as an important kind of photocatalyst in chemical and material science, due to its superior photocatalytic activity and photostability under visible‐light irradiation. The aim here is to address the enhancement mechanism of the photocatalytic performance of CdS/graphene composite photocatalysts, and systematically summarize recent progress regarding the design and synthesis of CdS/graphene nanocomposites. These nanocomposites are promising for a great diversity of applications in visible‐light photocatalytic fields, including artificial photosynthetic systems (photocatalytic hydrogen production and CO 2 reduction), environmental remediation, and organic photosynthesis. Special attention is given to the photocatalytic hydrogen production and pollutant photodegradation over CdS/graphene nanocomposite photocatalysts. Furthermore, perspectives on CdS/graphene‐based materials are discussed, including the various remaining challenges for large‐scale applications, identifying prospective areas for related research in this field.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

This work reports on the rational design of titania (TiO2)-based semiconductors for enhanced and synergistic sono-/photoinduced tumor eradication by creating an oxygen-deficient TiO2–x layer onto the surface of TiO2 nanocrystals, which can create a crystalline-disordered core/shell structure (TiO2@TiO2–x) with black color. As found in the lessons from traditional photocatalysis, such an oxygen-deficient TiO2–x layer with abundant oxygen defects facilitates and enhances the separation of electrons (e–) and holes (h+) from the energy-band structure upon external ultrasound irradiation, which can significantly improve the efficacy of sono-triggered sonocatalytic tumor therapy. Such an oxygen-deficient TiO2–x layer can also endow black titania nanoparticles with high photothermal-conversion efficiency (39.8%) at the NIR-II biowindow (1064 nm) for enhanced photothermal hyperthermia. Both in vitro cell level and systematic in vivo tumor-bearing mice xenograft evaluations have demonstrated the high synergistic efficacy of combined and enhanced sonodynamic therapy and photothermal ablation as assisted by oxygen-deficient black titania, which has achieved complete tumor eradication with high therapeutic biosafety and without obvious reoccurrence. This work not only provides the paradigm of high therapeutic efficacy of a combined sono-/photoinduced tumor-treatment protocol but also significantly broadens the nanomedical applications of semiconductor-based nanoplatforms by rational design of their nanostructures and control of their physiochemical properties.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Incorporation of gelatin microgel reduced cure time while it increased the elastic modulus and cross-linking density of the adhesive network. Most notably, the loss modulus values for microgel-containing adhesive were an order of magnitude higher when compared to microgel-free control. This drastic increase in the viscous dissipation ability of the adhesive is attributed to the introduction of reversible physical bonds into the adhesive network with the incorporation of the gelatin microgel. Additionally, incorporation of the microgel increased the adhesive properties of PEGDM by 1.5- to 2-fold. From in vitro cell culture studies, the composite adhesive is noncytotoxic and the incorporation of microgels provided binding site for promoting fibroblast attachment and viability. The subcutaneous implantation study indicated that the microgel-containing PEGDM adhesive is biocompatible and the incorporated microgels provided pockets for rapid cellular infiltration. Gelatin microgel incorporation was demonstrated to be a facile method to simultaneously enhance the adhesive property and the bioactivity of PEG-based adhesive.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Although they have the appropriate properties for injection, it may be advantageous to decouple injectability from the controlled release of encapsulated therapeutics. Toward this, composites of hydrogels and encapsulated microgels are introduced with microgels that are fabricated via microfluidics. The microgel cross‐linker controls degradation and entrapped molecule release, and the concentration of microgels alters composite hydrogel rheological properties. For the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), interleukin‐10 (IL‐10) is encapsulated in microgels and released from composites. In a rat model of MI, composites with IL‐10 reduce macrophage density after 1 week and improve scar thickness, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and the size of vascular structures after 4 weeks when compared to saline injection. Improvements are also observed with the composite without IL‐10 over saline, emphasizing the role of injectable hydrogels alone on tissue repair.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In one example, polymerization could be efficiently initiated and completed within 10 s with double bond conversions of approximately 80%. The initiating system could also be used in conjunction with reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization.

The combination of BP with CN strengthens the visible‐light harvesting ability, facilitates the charge separation in the photocatalytic process, and renders promoted activity of photoinduced molecular oxygen activation, such as superoxide radicals (·O 2 − ) evolution and H 2 O 2 production. This work highlights that coupling semiconductors with well‐matched band levels provide a flexible route to enhance the performance of photocatalysts for producing reactive oxygen species, and gives ideas for the design of highly active and metal‐free materials toward sustainable solar‐to‐chemical energy conversion and environmental remediation.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The experiments show that all selected catalysts can be involved in the activation step, but not all of them participated efficiently in the deactivation step. The redox properties and the stability of radical cations derived from the catalysts were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Laser flash photolysis (LFP) was used to determine the lifetime and activity of photoexcited catalysts. Kinetic analysis of the activation reaction according to dissociative electron-transfer (DET) theory suggests that the activation occurs only with an excited state of catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed the structures and stabilities of the radical cation intermediates as well as the reaction energy profiles of deactivation pathways with different photoredox catalysts. Both experiments and calculations suggest that the activation process undergoes a DET mechanism, while an associative electron transfer involving a termolecular encounter (the exact reverse of DET pathway) is favored in the deactivation process. This detailed study provides a deeper understanding of the chemical processes of metal-free ATRP that can aid the design of better catalytic systems. Additionally, this work elucidates several important common pathways involved in synthetically useful organic reactions catalyzed by photoredox catalysts.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Consequently, three-dimensional objects are fabricated by progressive, two-dimensional addition of material, curtailing fabrication rates and necessitating the incorporation of support structures to ensure the integrity of overhanging features. Here, we examine butyl nitrite as a UV-active photoinhibitor of blue light-induced photopolymerizations and explore its utilization to confine in depth the region polymerized in a volume of resin. By employing two perpendicular irradiation patterns at blue and near-UV wavelengths to independently effect either polymerization initiation or inhibition, respectively, we enable three-dimensional photopolymerization patterning in bulk resin, thereby complementing emergent approaches to volumetric 3D printing.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The exceptional properties of ILs have proved to be particularly useful in polymer science giving the potential to produce polymeric materials with improved properties or to immobilize ILs in polymer matrices while keeping their special characteristics. One of the possibilities is polymerization in ILs which can also affect positively polymerization reactions. An especially attractive technique is photopolymerization due to the ease of process control, short reaction time and ambient working temperature. This review gives a literature survey of developments in photopolymerization processes carried out in ILs as well as applications of these processes. It covers both the photopolymerization in ILs as well as photopolymerization of IL monomers. The first part presents a short overview of physicochemical and photochemical properties of ILs ; it includes also photochemical reactions and photoinitiation of polymerization in ILs .

Graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 4 ) has attracted worldwide attention due to its visible‐light activity, facile synthesis from low‐cost materials, chemical stability, and unique layered structure. However, the pure g‐C 3 N 4 photocatalyst still suffers from its low separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers, which results in unsatisfactory photocatalytic activity. Recently, g‐C 3 N 4 ‐based heterostructures have become research hotspots for their greatly enhanced charge carrier separation efficiency and photocatalytic performance. According to the different transfer mechanisms of photogenerated charge carriers between g‐C 3 N 4 and the coupled components, the g‐C 3 N 4 ‐based heterostructured photocatalysts can be divided into the following categories: g‐C 3 N 4 ‐based conventional type II heterojunction, g‐C 3 N 4 ‐based Z‐scheme heterojunction, g‐C 3 N 4 ‐based p–n heterojunction, g‐C 3 N 4 /metal heterostructure, and g‐C 3 N 4 /carbon heterostructure. This review summarizes the recent significant progress on the design of g‐C 3 N 4 ‐based heterostructured photocatalysts and their special separation/transfer mechanisms of photogenerated charge carriers.

Mechanical testing of octet truss unit cells in which the properties of the crossbars and vertices were independently modified revealed unique mechanical responses from the different compositions.

Using light to activate chemical reaction pathways in these systems not only leads to exquisite control over reaction dynamics, but also allows complex synthetic protocols to be easily achieved. Compared to polymerization systems mediated by thermal, chemical, or electrochemical means, photoinduced polymerization systems can potentially offer more versatile methods for macromolecular synthesis.

It is observed that the total charge carrier density and, importantly, the recombination dynamics are unchanged by photoinduced burn‐in. Charge extraction is used to monitor changes in the density of states (DOS) during degradation of the solar cells, and a broadening over time is observed. It is proposed that the V oc losses observed during burn‐in are caused by a redistribution of charge carriers in a broader DOS. The temperature and light intensity dependence of the V oc losses can be described with an analytical model that contains the amount of disorder broadening in a Gaussian DOS as the only fit parameter. Finally, the V oc loss in solar cells made from amorphous and crystalline polymers is compared and an increased stability observed in crystalline polymer solar cells is investigated. It is found that solar cells made from crystalline materials have a considerably higher charge carrier density than those with amorphous materials. The effects of a DOS broadening upon aging are suppressed in solar cells with crystalline materials due to their higher carrier density, making crystalline materials more stable against V oc losses during burn‐in.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here, a direct Z-scheme CdS-WO(3) photocatalyst without an electron mediator is fabricated by imitating natural photosynthesis of green plants. Photocatalytic activities of as-prepared samples are evaluated on the basis of photocatalytic CO(2) reduction to form CH(4) under visible light irradiation. These Z-scheme-heterostructured samples show a higher photocatalytic CO(2) reduction than single-phase photocatalysts. An optimized CdS-WO(3) heterostructure sample exhibits the highest CH(4) production rate of 1.02 μmol h(-1) g(-1) with 5 mol% CdS content, which exceeds the rates observed in single-phase WO(3) and CdS samples for approximately 100 and ten times under the same reaction condition, respectively. The enhanced photocatalytic activity could be attributed to the formation of a hierarchical direct Z-scheme CdS-WO(3) photocatalyst, resulting in an efficient spatial separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Reduction and oxidation catalytic centers are maintained in two different regions to minimize undesirable back reactions of the photocatalytic products. The introduction of CdS can enhance CO(2) molecule adsorption, thereby accelerating photocatalytic CO(2) reduction to CH(4). This study provides novel insights into the design and fabrication of high-performance artificial Z-scheme photocatalysts to perform photocatalytic CO(2) reduction.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Their translation toward biological applications is limited owing to the use of non-degradable components. Furthermore, size has been an impediment owing to the importance of achieving nanoscale (ca. 100 nm) dimensions, as opposed to microscale examples that are prevalent. Herein, we present a hybrid nanomotor that can be activated by near-infrared (NIR)-irradiation for the triggered delivery of internal cargo and facilitated transport of external agents to the cell. Utilizing biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(d,l-lactide) (PEG-PDLLA) block copolymers, with the two blocks connected via a pH sensitive imine bond, we generate nanoscopic polymersomes that are then modified with a hemispherical gold nanocoat. This Janus morphology allows such hybrid polymersomes to undergoing photothermal motility in response to thermal gradients generated by plasmonic absorbance of NIR irradiation, with velocities ranging up to 6.2±1.10 μm s-1 . These polymersome nanomotors (PNMs) are capable of traversing cellular membranes allowing intracellular delivery of molecular and macromolecular cargo.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Room temperature (RT) fast detection of toxic gases is still challenging. Recently, MoS2 transition metal dichalcogenides have sparked great attention in the research community due to their performance in gas sensing applications. However, MoS2 based gas sensors still suffer from long response and recovery times, especially at RT. Considering this challenge, here, we report photoactivated highly reversible and fast detection of NO2 sensors at room temperature (RT) by using mixed in-plane and edge-enriched p-MoS2 flakes (mixed MoS2). The sensor showed fast response with good sensitivity of ∼10.36% for 10 ppm of NO2 at RT without complete recovery. However, complete recovery was obtained with better sensor performance under UV light illumination at RT. The UV assisted NO2 sensing showed improved performance in terms of fast response and recovery kinetics with enhanced sensitivity to 10 ppm NO2 concentration. The sensor performance is also investigated under thermal energy, and a better sensor performance with reduced sensitivity and high selectivity toward NO2 was observed. A detailed gas sensing mechanism based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations for favorable NO2 adsorption sites on in-plane and edge-enriched MoS2 flakes is proposed. This study revealed the role of favorable adsorption sites in MoS2 flakes for the enhanced interaction of target gases and developed a highly sensitive, reversible, and fast gas sensor for next-generation toxic gases at room temperature.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The newly developed MOF can selectively capture and photoreduce CO2 with high efficiency under visible-light irradiation. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the presence of single Co atoms in the MOF can greatly boost the electron-hole separation efficiency in porphyrin units. Directional migration of photogenerated excitons from porphyrin to catalytic Co centers was witnessed, thereby achieving supply of long-lived electrons for the reduction of CO2 molecules adsorbed on Co centers. As a direct result, porphyrin MOF comprising atomically dispersed catalytic centers exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic conversion of CO2 , which is equivalent to a 3.13-fold improvement in CO evolution rate (200.6 μmol g-1 h-1 ) and a 5.93-fold enhancement in CH4 generation rate (36.67 μmol g-1 h-1 ) compared to the parent MOF.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

This series was designed on the basis of a judicious association of a carbazole-coumarin fused subunit and an O-acyl-α-oxooxime branch, which integrates an N–O photocleavable bond. Within this molecular framework, several substitution changes affecting specifically two distinctive sites of the oxime group have been proposed to rationalize some relevant structure–reactivity relationships. We show that the photobleaching rates of the oxime esters (OXEs) are clearly influenced by an ethyl-to-isopropyl substitution effect on the oxime methine carbon whereas the photoinitiating efficiency is mainly driven by a O-benzyl-to-O-acetyl substitution change. Of particular interest, we show that the photoinitiating efficiencies of these OXEs largely depart from their respective absorption spectra in such manner that their photopolymerization performance can be amplified by more than 2 orders of magnitude between 365 and 425 nm LED irradiation. This effect clearly outperforms the photoinitiating efficiency of the commercially available Irgacure OXE-02 oxime ester used as a reference. In the proposed mechanism that accounts for this original wavelength-dependent photopolymerization property, we highlighted the role of an imine-based transient species whose reactivity toward the acrylate monomer can be phototriggered promoting thereby an alternative competing reaction sequence.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In contrast, the research on supramolecular BCPs is still in its infancy and their generation by living processes remains a challenge. Here we report the formation of supramolecular block copolymers by two-component seeded living polymerization of properly designed perylene bisimides (PBIs) under precise kinetic control. Our detailed studies on thermodynamically and kinetically controlled supramolecular polymerization of three investigated PBIs, which contain hydrogen-bonding amide side groups in imide position and chlorine, methoxy, or methylthio substituents in 1,7 bay-positions, revealed that these PBIs form kinetically metastable H-aggregates, which can be transformed into the thermodynamically favored J-aggregates by seed-induced living polymerization. We show here that copolymerization of kinetically trapped states of one PBI with seeds of another PBI leads to the formation of supramolecular block copolymers by chain-growth process from the seed termini as confirmed by UV/vis spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). This work demonstrates for the first time the formation of triblock supramolecular polymer architectures with A-B-A and B-A-B block pattern by alternate two-component seeded polymerization in a living manner.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Two novel phenylisoquinoline-based iridium complexes with fluorine substituents (bis[5-fluoro-2-(1-isoquinolinyl-κN)phenyl-κC](2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato-κO3,κO5)-iridium (III) (Ir_b) and bis[3,5-difluoro-2-(1-isoquinolinyl-κN)phenyl-κC](2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato-κO3,κO5)-iridium (III) (Ir_c) are proposed as photoredox catalysts (also called photoinitiator catalysts) and incorporated into suitable photoinitiating systems for cationic and radical polymerization. (3,4-Epoxycyclohexane)methyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexylcarboxylate (EPOX) and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) were used as benchmark monomers for cationic and radical photopolymerization. These new catalysts are compared to our very recently proposed unsubstituted catalyst compound: bis[2-(1-isoquinolinyl-κN)phenyl-κC](2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato-κO3,κO5)-iridium (III) (Ir_a). Remarkably, these catalysts exhibit improved light absorption properties and are characterized by a panchromatic behavior which ensures the photosensitivity of the polymerizable films to blue, green and red lights. The photochemical properties as well as the chemical mechanisms associated with these catalysts are investigated by ESR spin-trapping, laser flash photolysis, steady state photolysis, cyclic voltammetry and luminescence experiments.

When released to the environment, plastics accumulate, and plastic debris in the world's oceans is of particular environmental concern. More than 60% of all floating debris in the oceans is plastic and amounts are increasing each year. Plastic polymers in the marine environment are exposed to sunlight, oxidants and physical stress, and over time they weather and degrade. The degradation processes and products must be understood to detect and evaluate potential environmental hazards. Some attention has been drawn to additives and persistent organic pollutants that sorb to the plastic surface, but so far the chemicals generated by degradation of the plastic polymers themselves have not been well studied from an environmental perspective. In this paper we review available information about the degradation pathways and chemicals that are formed by degradation of the six plastic types that are most widely used in Europe. We extrapolate that information to likely pathways and possible degradation products under environmental conditions found on the oceans' surface. The potential degradation pathways and products depend on the polymer type. UV-radiation and oxygen are the most important factors that initiate degradation of polymers with a carbon-carbon backbone, leading to chain scission. Smaller polymer fragments formed by chain scission are more susceptible to biodegradation and therefore abiotic degradation is expected to precede biodegradation. When heteroatoms are present in the main chain of a polymer, degradation proceeds by photo-oxidation, hydrolysis, and biodegradation. Degradation of plastic polymers can lead to low molecular weight polymer fragments, like monomers and oligomers, and formation of new end groups, especially carboxylic acids.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we demonstrate that efficient fixation of N2 to NH3 can proceed under room temperature and atmospheric pressure in water using visible light illuminated BiOBr nanosheets of oxygen vacancies in the absence of any organic scavengers and precious-metal cocatalysts. The designed catalytic oxygen vacancies of BiOBr nanosheets on the exposed {001} facets, with the availability of localized electrons for π-back-donation, have the ability to activate the adsorbed N2, which can thus be efficiently reduced to NH3 by the interfacial electrons transferred from the excited BiOBr nanosheets.

Traditional hydrogels are limited in short‐term usage under room temperature, as it is difficult to retain water under cold or hot environment. Inspired by the antifreezing/antiheating behaviors from nature, and based on mussel chemistry, an adhesive and conductive hydrogel is developed with long‐lasting moisture lock‐in capability and extreme temperature tolerance, which is formed in a binary‐solvent system composed of water and glycerol. Polydopamine (PDA)‐decorated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are incorporated into the hydrogel, which assign conductivity to the hydrogel and serve as nanoreinforcements to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. The catechol groups on PDA and viscous glycerol endow the hydrogel with high tissue adhesiveness. Particularly, the hydrogel is thermal tolerant to maintain all the properties under extreme wide tempreature spectrum (−20 or 60 °C) or stored for a long term. In summary, this mussel‐inspired hydrogel is a promising material for self‐adhesive bioelectronics to detect biosignals in cold or hot environments, and also as a dressing to protect skin from injuries related to frostbites or burns.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Traditional manufacturing techniques have limitations in controlling the geometry and architecture of many soft actuation and sensing systems, which compromise their performance as well as applications. With the emergence of 3D printing, directly transforming 3D models into real objects becomes possible. In particular, vat photopolymerization techniques, represented by stereolithography, are capable of printing all‐in‐one and lab‐on‐a‐chip devices with fast speed and high accuracy. Novel polymer formulations, including functional resins, hydrogels, elastomers, polymer blends, composites, and biological materials, have been developed for vat photopolymerization 3D printing to produce highly stable architectures, which prompts a remarkable revolution in mechanics and materials for soft electronics.

We designed the constituents and compositions to exhibit desired thermomechanical behavior (including rubbery modulus, glass transition temperature and failure strain which is more than 300% and larger than any existing printable materials) to enable controlled shape memory behavior. We used a high resolution, high contrast digital micro display to ensure high resolution of photo-curing methacrylate based SMPs that requires higher exposure energy than more common acrylate based polymers. An automated material exchange process enables the manufacture of 3D composite architectures from multiple photo-curable SMPs. In order to understand the behavior of the 3D composite microarchitectures, we carry out high fidelity computational simulations of their complex nonlinear, time-dependent behavior and study important design considerations including local deformation, shape fixity and free recovery rate. Simulations are in good agreement with experiments for a series of single and multimaterial components and can be used to facilitate the design of SMP 3D structures.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, maintaining bacterial cell viability during storage and gastrointestinal transit remains a challenge. Encapsulation of bifidobacteria within food-grade hydrogel particles potentially mitigates their sensitivity to environmental stresses. In this study, Bifidobacterium longum subspecies and strains were encapsulated in core-shell microgels consisting of an alginate core and a microgel shell. Encapsulated obligate anaerobes Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis and Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum exhibited differences in viability in a strain-dependent manner, without a discernable relationship to subspecies lineage. This includes viability under aerobic storage conditions and modeled gastrointestinal tract conditions. Coating alginate microgels with chitosan did not improve viability compared to cells encapsulated in alginate microgels alone, suggesting that modifying the surface charge alone does not enhance delivery. Thus hydrogel beads have great potential for improving the stability and efficacy of bifidobacterial probiotics in various nutritional interventions.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Currently, this rapidly developing field is based on metal-containing segments, typically TiO2 and precious metals. Herein, we present metal-free tubular micromotors solely based on graphitic carbon nitride, as highly scalable and low-cost micromachines that can be actuated by turning on/off the light source. These micromotors are able to move by a photocatalytic-induced bubble-propelled mechanism under visible light irradiation, without any metal-containing part or biochemical molecule on their structure. Furthermore, they exhibit interesting properties, such as a translucent tubular structure that allows the optical visualization of the O2 bubble formation and migration inside the microtubes, as well as inherent fluorescence and adsorptive capability. Such properties were exploited for the removal of a heavy metal from contaminated water with the concomitant optical monitoring of its adsorption by fluorescence quenching. This multifunctional approach contributes to the development of metal-free bubble-propelled tubular micromotors actuated under visible light irradiation for environmental applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The prepared microgel systems were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The composite microgel, with the incorporation of nHAp, showed an increased elastic modulus and thermal stability and had shear-thinning behavior proving the injectability of the system. The protein adsorption, cytocompatibility, and migration of rabbit adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (rASCs) were also studied. Chitin-PCL-nHAp microgel elicited an early osteogenic differentiation compared to control gel.

However, it is difficult to find a material with balanced electronic and mechanical performance. Here, a simple method is developed to introduce ion‐rich pores into strong hydrogel matrix and fabricate a novel ionic conductive hydrogel with a high level of electronic and mechanical properties. The proposed ionic conductive hydrogel is achieved by physically cross‐linking the tough biocompatible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel as the matrix and embedding hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) biopolymer fibers inside matrix followed by salt solution soaking. The wrinkle and dense structure induced by salting in PVA matrix provides large stress (1.3 MPa) and strain (975%). The well‐distributed porous structure as well as ion migration–facilitated ion‐rich environment generated by embedded HPC fibers dramatically enhances ionic conductivity (up to 3.4 S m −1 , at f = 1 MHz). The conductive hybrid hydrogel can work as an artificial nerve in a 3D printed robotic hand, allowing passing of stable and tunable electrical signals and full recovery under robotic hand finger movements. This natural rubber‐like ionic conductive hydrogel has a promising application in artificial flexible electronics.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, fabricating a hydrogel with both adequate adhesiveness and excellent mechanical properties remains a challenge. Inspired by the adhesion mechanism of mussels, we used a two-step process to develop an adhesive and tough polydopamine-clay-polyacrylamide (PDA-clay-PAM) hydrogel. Dopamine was intercalated into clay nanosheets and limitedly oxidized between the layers, resulting in PDA-intercalated clay nanosheets containing free catechol groups. Acrylamide monomers were then added and in situ polymerized to form the hydrogel. Unlike previous single-use adhesive hydrogels, our hydrogel showed repeatable and durable adhesiveness. It adhered directly on human skin without causing an inflammatory response and was easily removed without causing damage. The adhesiveness of this hydrogel was attributed to the presence of enough free catechol groups in the hydrogel, which were created by controlling the oxidation process of the PDA in the confined nanolayers of clay. This mimicked the adhesion mechanism of the mussels, which maintain a high concentration of catechol groups in the confined nanospace of their byssal plaque. The hydrogel also displayed superior toughness, which resulted from nanoreinforcement by clay and PDA-induced cooperative interactions with the hydrogel networks. Moreover, the hydrogel favored cell attachment and proliferation, owning to the high cell affinity of PDA. Rat full-thickness skin defect experiments demonstrated that the hydrogel was an excellent dressing. This free-standing, adhesive, tough, and biocompatible hydrogel may be more convenient for surgical applications than adhesives that involve in situ gelation and extra agents.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Although having broader potential applications, producing stable aqueous inks of liquid metals keeps challenging because of rapid oxidation of liquid metal when exposing to water and oxygen. Here, a biocompatible aqueous ink is produced by encapsulating alloy nanodroplets of gallium and indium (EGaIn) into microgels of marine polysaccharides. During sonicating bulk EGaIn in aqueous alginate solution, alginate not only facilitates the downsizing process via coordination of their carboxyl groups with Ga ions but also forms microgel shells around EGaIn droplets. Due to the deceasing oxygen‐permeability of microgel shells, aqueous ink of EGaIn nanodroplets can maintain colloidal and chemical stability for a period of &gt;7 d. Crosslinked alginate‐gel with tunable thickness can retard the generation and release of toxic cations, thereby affording high biocompatibility. The soft alginate shells also enable to recover electric conductivity of EGaIn layers by “mechanical sintering” for applications in microcircuits, electric‐thermal actuators, and wearable sensors, offering huge potential for electronic tattoos, artificial limbs, electric skins, etc.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The production process of P‐TCN involves two steps: 1) the precursor was prepared by self‐assembly of melamine with cyanuric acid from in situ hydrolysis of melamine under phosphorous acid‐assisted hydrothermal conditions; 2) the pyrolysis was initiated at the center of precursor under heating, thus giving the hexagonal P‐TCN. The tubular structure favors the enhancement of light scattering and active sites. Meanwhile, the introduction of phosphorus leads to a narrow band gap and increased electric conductivity. Thus, the P‐TCN exhibited a high hydrogen evolution rate of 67 μmol h −1 (0.1 g catalyst, λ &gt;420 nm) in the presence of sacrificial agents, and an apparent quantum efficiency of 5.68 % at 420 nm, which is better than most of bulk g‐C 3 N 4 reported.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, an interaction potential unifying their behavior across the entire phase diagram is sorely lacking. Here we investigate microgel suspensions in the fluid regime at different volume fractions and temperatures, and in the presence of another population of small microgels, combining confocal microscopy experiments and numerical simulations. We find that effective interactions between microgels are clearly temperature dependent. In addition, microgel mixtures possess an enhanced stability compared to hard colloid mixtures - a property not predicted by a simple Hertzian model. Based on numerical calculations we propose a multi-Hertzian model, which reproduces the experimental behaviour for all studied conditions.

Many existing tools with nanoscopic resolution or better, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) methods, can generate highly detailed maps of nanoscopic structures. However, while these approaches provide great views of the morphological properties of nanomaterials, it has proven more challenging to derive chemical information from the corresponding images. To address this issue, attempts have been made to dress existing nanoscopy methods with spectroscopic sensitivity. A powerful approach in this direction is the combination of scan probe techniques with optical illumination, which aims to marry the nanoscopic resolution provided by a sharp tip with the chemical selectivity provided by optical spectroscopy. Examples of this approach include existing techniques such as scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. A new and emerging technique in this direction is photoinduced force microscopy (PiFM), which enables spectroscopic probing of materials with a spatial resolution well under 10 nm.In PiFM, the sample is optically excited and the response of the material is probed directly in the near-field by reading out the time-integrated force between the tip and the sample. Because the magnitude of the force is dependent on the photoinduced polarization in the sample, PiFM exhibits spectroscopic sensitivity. The photoinduced forces measured in PiFM are spatially confined on the nanometer scale, which translates into a very high spatial resolution even under ambient conditions. The PiFM approach is compatible with a wide range optical excitation frequencies, from the visible to the mid-infrared, enabling nanoscale imaging contrast based on either electronic or vibrational transitions in the sample. These properties make PiFM an attractive method for the visualization and spectroscopic characterization of a vast variety of nano materials, from semiconducting nanoparticles to polymer thin films to sensitive measurements of single molecules.In this Account, we review the principles of the PiFM technique and discuss the basic components of the photoinduced force microscope. We highlight the imaging properties of the PiFM instrument and demonstrate the inherent spectroscopic sensitivity of the technique. Furthermore, we show that the PiFM approach can be used to probe both the linear and nonlinear optical properties of nano materials. In addition, we provide several examples of PiFM imaging applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

We herein report an all-in-one fluorescent semiconducting polymer based far-red to near-infrared (NIR) Pdot nanoprobe for the ratiometric detection of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). The fabrication takes the advantage of flexible polymer design by incorporating target-sensitive and target-inert fluorophores into a single conjugated polymer to avoid leakage or differential photobleaching problems existed in other nanoprobes. The obtained nanoprobe has improved performance in HOCl sensing, such as high brightness, ideal far-red to NIR optical window, excellent photostability, self-referenced ratiometric response, fast response, and high selectivity. The dual-emission property allows the sensitive imaging of HOCl fluctuations produced in living macrophage cells and peritonitis of living mice with high contrast. This study not only provides a powerful and promising nanoprobe to be potentially used in the investigations of in situ HOCl status of diseases in living systems but also puts forward the design strategy of a new category of ratiometric fluorescent probes facilitating precise and reliable measurement in biological systems.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Emulsion microgels were subjected to skin mimicking or oral cavity mimicking conditions, i.e., smooth hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane ball-on-disc tribological tests, in the absence or presence of salivary enzyme (α-amylase). In the absence of enzyme, emulsion microgel particles (30-60 vol % particle content) conserved the lubricating properties of emulsion droplets, providing considerably lower friction coefficients (μ ≤ 0.1) in the mixed lubrication regime compared to plain microgel particles (0 wt % oil). Upon addition of enzyme, the lubrication performance of emulsion microgel particles became strongly dependent on the particles' oil content. Microgel particles encapsulating 5-10 wt % oil showed a double plateau mixed lubrication regime having a lowest friction coefficient μ ∼ 0.03 and highest μ ∼ 0.1, the latter higher than with plain microgel particles. An oil content of 15 wt % was necessary for the microgel particles to lubricate similarly to the emulsion droplets, where both systems showed a normal mixed lubrication regime with μ ≤ 0.03. The observed trends in tribology, theoretical considerations, and the combined results of rheology, light scattering, and confocal fluorescence microscopy suggested that the mechanism behind the low friction coefficients was a synergistic enzyme- and shear-triggered release of the emulsion droplets, improving lubrication. The present work thus demonstrates experimentally and theoretically a novel biolubricant additive with stimuli-responsive properties capable of providing efficient boundary lubrication between soft polymeric surfaces.

The liquid crystal order amplifies the deformation of copolymerized azobenzene, which takes place on molecular length scales, to a micrometre-sized macroscopic phenomenon based on changes in density. We postulate a new mechanism in which continuous oscillating dynamics of the trans-to-cis isomerization of the azobenzene overrules the net conversion, which is currently considered as the origin. This is supported by a significant local density decrease when both the trans and cis isomers are triggered simultaneously, either by dual-wavelength excitation or by the addition of a fluorescent agent converting part of the light to the cis-actuating wavelengths. This new insight provides a general guideline to boost free volume generation leading not only to larger macroscopic deformations but also to controllable and faster non-equilibrium dynamics.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In this study, we demonstrated a facile and efficient way to synthesize protein-based nanoparticles by taking advantage of photoinitiated reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization-induced self-assembly by using multi-RAFT modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a macro-RAFT agent. The growth of the PHPMA chains results in the increase of the hydrophobicity of the star BSA-PHPMA conjugates, and when reaching the critical aggregation concentration in aqueous solution, they will aggregate into nanoparticles via the hydrophobic interaction of PHPMA. The generated nanoparticles also showed excellent encapsulation ability toward both hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, and as a proof of concept, after loading cancer drug DOX or biomacromolecule DNA, the protease-mediated release of the encapsulants was demonstrated.

This technology demonstrates the light-enhanced generation of charge carriers and reactive radicals that non-selectively degrade various organic dyes into water, CO2, and other organic compounds via direct photodegradation or a sensitization-mediated degradation process. The overall efficiency of the photocatalysis system is closely dependent upon operational parameters that govern the adsorption and photodegradation of dye molecules, including the initial dye concentration, pH of the solution, temperature of the reaction medium, and light intensity. Additionally, the charge-carrier properties of the photocatalyst strongly affect the generation of reactive species in the heterogeneous photodegradation and thereby dictate the photodegradation efficiency. Herein, this comprehensive review discusses the pseudo kinetics and mechanisms of the photodegradation reactions. The operational factors affecting the photodegradation of either cationic or anionic dye molecules, as well as the charge-carrier properties of the photocatalyst, are also fully explored. By further analyzing past works to clarify key active species for photodegradation reactions and optimal conditions, this review provides helpful guidelines that can be applied to foster the development of efficient photodegradation systems.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we demonstrate a thermoresponsive, smart colorimetric patch based on a thermoresponsive plasmonic microgel embedded in a stretchable hydrogel film. To achieve a fast and efficient thermoresponsive color change, raspberry-shaped plasmonic microgels were fabricated by decorating gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels, which exhibit reversible and strain-insensitive color shifts (between red and grayish violet) in response to a temperature change. The smart colorimetric patch containing a plasmonic microgels exhibits a significant extinction peak shift (176 nm) in a short time (1 s), with a temperature-sensing resolution of 0.2 °C. Moreover, the transition temperature of the plasmonic microgel can be finely tuned by additives and comonomers, so that the exquisite temperature visualization can be conducted over a wide temperature range of 25‒40 °C by assembling plasmonic microgel films with different transition temperatures into an array patch. For proof-of-concept demonstrations, a freestanding smart colorimetric patch was utilized as a spatial temperature scanner and a colorimetric thermometer for a thermoresponsive actuator, which is potentially applicable in smart, wearable sensors and soft robotics. Thin flexible patches that adhere to human skin and report deviations in temperature have been developed by researchers in South Korea. Hyunhyub Ko and colleagues from the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology made water-filled polymers known as hydrogels into microscale beads and coated them with light-emitting gold nanoparticles. They then embedded the beads into a stretchable transparent film. Because the tiny microgels swell and shrink in response to temperature, the nanoparticles likewise move closer or further apart, an action that causes them to produce differently colored light. The film, even when stretched or bent, detected temperature changes from 25 to 45 °C by vivid color changes. A prototype \"smart hand\" capable of rapidly sensing heat or cold when wrapped around fingertips or wrists could find use in soft robotics. A thermoresponsive smart colorimetric patch was fabricated by embedding thermoresponsive plasmonic microgels in a stretchable hydrogel film.

Herein, this paper reports wavelength-dependent photoconversional polymeric vesicles of boron dipyrromethene (Bodipy) fluorophore for either PDT under 660 nm irradiation or PTT under 785 nm irradiation. After being assembled within polymeric vesicles at a high drug loading, Bodipy molecules aggregate in the conformations of both J-type and H-type, thereby causing red-shifted absorption into near-infrared region, ultralow radiative transition, and ideal resistance to photobleaching. Such vesicles further possess enhanced blood circulation, preferable tumor accumulation, as well as superior cell uptake as compared to free Bodipy. In particular, the vesicles mainly generate abundant intracellular singlet oxygen for PDT treatment under 660 nm irradiation, while they primarily produce a potent hyperthermia for PTT with tumor ablation through singlet oxygen-synergized photothermal necrosis under 785 nm irradiation. This approach provides a facile and general strategy to tune photoconversion characteristics of fluorophore dyes for wavelength-dependent photoinduced cancer therapy.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Fluoroalkylated compounds are considered particularly important in pharmaceutical chemistry because of their superior lipophilicity, binding selectivity, metabolic stability, and bioavailability to those of their nonfluoroalkylated analogues. We have developed various methods for the synthesis of fluoroalkylated substances that rely on the use of visible-light photoredox catalysis, a powerful preparative tool owing to its environmental benignity and mechanistic versatility in promoting a large number of synthetically important reactions with high levels of selectivity. In this Account, we describe the results of our efforts, which have led to the development of visible-light photocatalytic methods for the introduction of a variety of fluoroalkyl groups (such as, -CF3, -CF2R, -CH2CF3, -C3F7, and -C4F9) and arylthiofluoroalkyl groups (such as, -CF2SPh, -C2F4SAr, and -C4F8SAr) to organic substances. In these studies, electron-deficient carbon-centered fluoroalkyl radicals were successfully generated by the appropriate choice of fluoroalkyl source, photocatalyst, additives, and solvent. The redox potentials of the photocatalysts and the fluoroalkyl sources and the choice of sacrificial electron donor or acceptor as the additive affected the photocatalytic pathway, determining whether an oxidative or reductive quenching pathway was operative for the generation of key fluoroalkyl radicals. Notably, we have observed that additives significantly affect the efficiencies and selectivities of these reactions and can even change the outcome of the reaction by playing additional roles during its course. For instance, a tertiary amine as an additive in the reaction medium can act not only as a sacrificial electron donor in photoredox catalysis but also as a hydrogen atom source, an elimination base for dehydrohalogenation of the intermediate, and also a Brønsted base for deprotonation. In the same context, the selection of solvent is also critical since it affects the rate and selectivity of reactions depending upon its polarity and reagent solubilizing ability and plays additional roles in the process, for example, as a hydrogen atom source. By clearly understanding the roles of additives and solvent, we designed several controlled fluoroalkylation reactions where different products were formed selectively from the same starting substrates. In addition, we could exploit one of the most important advantages of radical reactions, that is, the use of unactivated π-systems such as alkenes, alkynes, arenes, and heteroarenes as radical acceptors without prefunctionalization. Furthermore, fluoroalkylation processes under mild room-temperature reaction conditions tolerate various functional groups and are therefore easily applicable to late-stage modifications of highly functionalized advanced intermediates.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In bioprinting, these inks are often hydrogels with controlled rheological properties that can be stabilized after deposition. Here, an alternate approach is developed where the ink is composed exclusively of jammed microgels, which are designed to incorporate a range of properties through microgel design (e.g., composition, size) and through the mixing of microgels. The jammed microgel inks are shear‐thinning to permit flow and rapidly recover upon deposition, including on surfaces or when deposited in 3D within hydrogel supports, and can be further stabilized with secondary cross‐linking. This platform allows the use of microgels engineered from various materials (e.g., thiol‐ene cross‐linked hyaluronic acid (HA), photo‐cross‐linked poly(ethylene glycol), thermo‐sensitive agarose) and that incorporate cells, where the jamming process and printing do not decrease cell viability. The versatility of this particle‐based approach opens up numerous potential biomedical applications through the printing of a more diverse set of inks.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

While the plasmonic hot electrons can be harnessed to drive unconventional photocatalytic molecular transformations at the nanoparticle–molecule interfaces, a set of fundamentally important issues concerning detailed reaction mechanisms still remain poorly understood. Here we use surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as a unique time-resolving and molecular finger-printing tool to spectroscopically resolve the complex kinetics and underlying pathways of plasmon-driven oxidative coupling of thiophenol derivatives chemisorbed on the surfaces of optically excited plasmonic Ag nanostructures. A hybrid suprananostructure composed of an SiO2 bead densely decorated with Ag nanocubes was used as both the SERS substrate and the plasmonic photocatalyst under near-infrared excitations. Through deliberately designed time-resolved single-particle SERS measurements, we have been able to pinpoint the effects of excitation power, local-field enhancement, interfacial oxygen abundance, molecular structures, and photothermal heating on the kinetics and yields of the hot electron-driven oxidative coupling reactions. Our time-resolved SERS results provide compelling experimental evidence for the steady-state photoactivated oxygen, revealing that the chemical transformations of thiophenol derivatives rather than the photo-activation of interfacial oxygen constitute the kinetic bottlenecks along the multistep reaction pathways, while the overall reaction rates are dynamically maneuvered by the photoactivated oxygen at its steady-state concentrations.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

A variety of cross-coupling methods have been well established, mainly using transition metal mediated reactions between prefunctionalized substrates and arenes or C–H arylations with functionalization in only one coupling partner. Although highly developed, one drawback of the established sp2–sp2 arylations is the required transition metal catalyst, often in combination with specific ligands and additives. Therefore, photoredox mediated arylation methods have been developed as alternative over the past decade.We begin our survey with visible light photo-Meerwein arylation reactions, which allow C–H arylation of heteroarenes, enones, alkenes, and alkynes with organic dyes, such as eosin Y, as the photocatalyst. A good number of examples from different groups illustrate the broad application of the reaction in synthetic transformations. While initially only photo-Meerwein arylation–elimination processes were reported, the reaction was later extended to photo-Meerwein arylation–addition reactions giving access to the photoinduced three component synthesis of amides and esters from alkenes, aryl diazonium salts, nitriles or formamides, respectively. Other substrates with redox-active leaving groups have been explored in photocatalyzed arylation reactions, such as diaryliodonium and triarylsulfonium salts, and arylsulfonyl chlorides. We discus some examples with their scope and limitations.The scope of arylation reagents for photoredox reactions was extended to aryl halides. The challenge here is the extremely negative reduction potential of aryl halides in the initial electron transfer step compared to, e.g., aryl diazonium or diaryliodonium salts. In order to reach reduction potentials over −2.0 V vs SCE two consecutive photoinduced electron transfer steps were used. The intermediary formed colored radical anion of the organic dye perylenediimide is excited by a second photon allowing the one electron reduction of acceptor substituted aryl chlorides. The radical anion of the aryl halide fragments under the loss of a halide ion and the aryl radical undergoes C–H arylation with biologically important pyrrole derivatives or adds to a double bond. Rhodamine 6G as an organic photocatalyst allows an even higher degree of control of the reaction. The dye is photoreduced in the presence of an amine donor under irradiation with green light (e.g., 530 nm), yielding its radical anion, which is a mild reducing reagent. The hypsochromic shift of the absorption of the rhodamine 6G radical anion toward blue region of the visible light spectrum allows its selective excitation using blue light (e.g., 455 nm). The excited radical anion is highly reducing and able to activate even bromoanisole for C–H arylation reactions, although only in moderate yield.Photoredox catalytic C–H arylation reactions are valuable alternatives to metal catalyzed reactions. They have an excellent functional group tolerance, could potentially avoid metal containing catalysts, and use visible light as a traceless reagent for the activation of arylating reagents.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Current incandescent and fluorescent lamps are being replaced by the LEDs at a rapid pace. Apart from extremely high energy efficiency, the LEDs have other advantages such as longer lifespan, lower heat generation, and improved color rendering without using harmful chemicals. One additional benefit of LEDs is that they are capable of switching to different light intensity at a very fast rate. This functionality has given rise to a novel communication technology (known as visible light communication-VLC) where LED luminaires can be used for high speed data transfer. This survey provides a technology overview and review of existing literature of visible light communication and sensing. This paper provides a detailed survey of 1) visible light communication system and characteristics of its various components such as transmitter and receiver; 2) physical layer properties of visible light communication channel, modulation methods, and MIMO techniques; 3) medium access techniques; 4) system design and programmable platforms; and 5) visible light sensing and application such as indoor localization, gesture recognition, screen-camera communication, and vehicular networking.

Here we demonstrate that a porphyrin-involved metal-organic framework (MOF), PCN-222, can selectively capture and further photoreduce CO2 with high efficiency under visible-light irradiation. Mechanistic information gleaned from ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (combined with time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy) has elucidated the relationship between the photocatalytic activity and the electron-hole separation efficiency. The presence of a deep electron trap state in PCN-222 effectively inhibits the detrimental, radiative electron-hole recombination. As a direct result, PCN-222 significantly enhances photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into formate anion compared to the corresponding porphyrin ligand itself.

Here we demonstrate microencapsulation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in small (&lt;100 μm diameter) microgels utilizing parallel droplet generators on a two-layer elastomer device, which has 600% increased throughput vs. single-nozzle devices. Distribution of microgel diameters were compared between products of parallel vs. single-nozzle configurations for two square nozzle widths, 35 and 100 μm. Microgels produced on parallel nozzles were equivalent to those produced on single nozzles, with substantially the same polydispersity. Microencapsulation of hMSCs was compared for parallel nozzle devices of each width. Thirty five micrometer wide nozzle devices could be operated at twice the cell concentration of 100 μm wide nozzle devices but produced more empty microgels than predicted by a Poisson distribution. Hundred micrometer wide nozzle devices produced microgels as predicted by a Poisson distribution. Polydispersity of microgels did not increase with the addition of cells for either nozzle width. hMSCs encapsulated on 35 μm wide nozzle devices had reduced viability (~70%) and a corresponding decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion compared to hMSCs cultured on tissue culture (TC) plastic. Encapsulating hMSCs using 100 μm wide nozzle devices mitigated loss of viability and function, as measured by VEGF secretion.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, many of the critical mechanistic aspects of this class of reactions remain poorly understood. In particular, the degree to which visible light photoredox reactions involve radical chain processes has been a point of some disagreement that has not been subjected to systematic analysis. We have now performed quantum yield measurements to demonstrate that three representative, mechanistically distinct photoredox processes involve product-forming chain reactions. Moreover, we show that the combination of quantum yield and luminescence quenching experiments provides a rapid method to estimate the length of these chains. Together, these measurements constitute a robust, operationally facile strategy for characterizing chain processes in a wide range of visible light photoredox reactions.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The resultant samples were characterized by different techniques, such as XRD, SEM, and EDX. The influence of preparation conditions such as calcination temperature and composite ratio on the degradation of methyl orange (MO) was investigated. ZnO prepared with a composite ratio of 4:1 and calcination temperature of 400 °C exhibited 99.70% removal rate for MO. The effect of operation parameters on the degradation was also studied. Results showed that the removal rate of azo dyes increased with the increased dosage of catalyst and decreased initial concentration of azo dyes and the acidic condition is favorable for degradation. Furthermore, the kinetics and scavengers of the reactive species during the degradation were also investigated. It was found that the degradation of azo dyes fitted the first-order kinetics and superoxide ions were the main species. The proposed photocatalyst can efficiently and rapidly degrade azo dyes; thus, this economical and environment-friendly photocatalyst can be applied to the treatment of wastewater contaminated with synthetic dyes.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Current research efforts for N2 reduction mainly focus on the metal-based catalysts using the electrochemical approach, while metal-free or solar-driven catalysts have been rarely explored. Herein, on the basis of a concept of electron \"acceptance-donation\", a metal-free photocatalyst, namely, boron (B) atom, decorated on the optically active graphitic-carbon nitride (B/g-C3N4), for the reduction of N2 is proposed by using extensive first-principles calculations. Our results reveal that gas phase N2 can be efficiently reduced into NH3 on B/g-C3N4 through the enzymatic mechanism with a record low onset potential (0.20 V). Moreover, the B-decorated g-C3N4 can significantly enhance the visible light absorption, rendering them ideal for solar-driven reduction of N2. Importantly, the as-designed catalyst is further demonstrated to hold great promise for synthesis due to its extremely high stability. Our work is the first report of metal-free single atom photocatalyst for N2 reduction, offering cost-effective opportunities for advancing sustainable NH3 production.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Nevertheless, it remains challenging to achieve efficient 3D printing due to the compromise between print speed and resolution. Herein, we report an efficient 3D printing approach based on the photooxidation of ketocoumarin that functions as the photosensitizer during photopolymerization, which can simultaneously deliver high print speed (5.1 cm h −1 ) and high print resolution (23 μm) on a common 3D printer. Mechanistically, the initiating radical and deethylated ketocoumarin are both generated upon visible light exposure, with the former giving rise to rapid photopolymerization and high print speed while the latter ensuring high print resolution by confining the light penetration. By comparison, the printed feature is hard to identify when the ketocoumarin encounters photoreduction due to the increased lateral photopolymerization. The proposed approach here provides a viable solution towards efficient additive manufacturing by controlling the photoreaction of photosensitizers during photopolymerization.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Their booming efficiency, feasible processability, and good compatibility with large‐scale deposition techniques make perovskite solar cells (PSCs) desirable candidates for next‐generation photovoltaic devices. Despite these advantages, the lifespans of solar cells are far below the industry‐needed 25 years. In fact, numerous PSCs throughout the literature show severely hampered stability under illumination. Herein, several photoinduced degradation mechanisms are discussed. With light radiation, the organic–inorgainc perovskites are prone to phase segregation or chemical decomposition; the oxide electron transport layers (ETLs) tend to introduce new defects at the interface; the commonly used small molecules‐based hole transport layers (HTLs) typically suffer from poor photostability and dopant diffusion during device operation. It has been demonstrated the photoinduced degradation can take place in every functional layer, including the active layer, ETL, HTL, and their interfaces. An overview of these degradation categories is provided in this review, in the hope of encouraging further research and optimization of relevant devices.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The dictated activation of the biosensing process in living cells enables the spatiotemporal target detection in single living cells. Herein, a kind of o-nitrobenzylphosphate ester hairpin nucleic acid was introduced as a photoresponsive DNA probe for light-activated ATP detection in single living cells. Two methods to spatiotemporally activate the probe in single living cells were discussed. One method was the usage of the micrometer-sized optical fiber (about 5 μm) to guide the UV light (λ = 365 nm) to selectively activate the photoresponsive DNA probe in single living cells. The second method involved a two-photon laser confocal scanning microscope to selectively irradiate the photoresponsive DNA probes confined in single living cells via two-photon irradiation (λ = 740 nm). ATP aptamer integrated in the activated DNA probes selectively interacted with the target ATP, resulting in dictated signal generation. Furthermore, the photoactivated biosensing process enables dictated dual-model ATP detection in single living cells with \"Signal-ON\" fluorescence signal and \"Signal-OFF\" electrochemical signal outputs. The developed photoactivated biosensor for dictated ATP detection with high spatiotemporal resolution in single living cells at a desired time and desired place suggests the possibility to monitor biomarkers during different cell cycles.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, despite of the effort devoted to microgels at ultrahigh densities, we know surprisingly little about their response to their environment at effective volume fractions ϕ eff above close packing (ϕ cp ), and the existing information is often contradictory. Here we report direct measurements of the size and shape of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels at concentrations below and above ϕ cp using the zero average contrast method in small-angle neutron scattering. We complement these experiments with measurements of the average interparticle distances using small-angle x-ray scattering, and a determination of the glass transition using dynamic light scattering.

However, even by the most powerful current methods, dye molecules that discolor and destabilize the materials need to be doped in, complicating the process. We present a dye-free alignment patterning technique, based on a scanning wave photopolymerization (SWaP) concept, that achieves a spatial light-triggered mass flow to direct molecular order using scanning light to propagate the wavefront. This enables one to generate macroscopic, arbitrary 2D alignment patterns in a wide variety of optically transparent polymer films from various polymerizable mesogens with sufficiently high birefringence (>0.1) merely by single-step photopolymerization, without alignment layers or polarized light sources. A set of 150,000 arrays of a radial alignment pattern with a size of 27.4 μm × 27.4 μm were successfully inscribed by SWaP, in which each individual pattern is smaller by a factor of 104 than that achievable by conventional photoalignment methods. This dye-free inscription of microscopic, complex alignment patterns over large areas provides a new pathway for designing higher-performance optical and mechanical devices.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Adapting these materials for 3D bioprinting, while maintaining sufficient void space to enable cell migration, can be challenging, since the rheological properties that determine printability are strongly influenced by microgel packing and void fraction. In this work, a strategy is proposed to decouple printability and void fraction by blending UV-crosslinkable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) microgels with sacrificial gelatin microgels to form composite inks. It is observed that inks with an apparent viscosity greater than ≈100 Pa s (corresponding to microgel concentrations ≥5 wt%) have rheological properties that enable extrusion-based printing of multilayered structures in air. By altering the ratio of GelMA to sacrificial gelatin microgels, while holding total concentration constant at 6 wt%, a family of GelMA:gelatin microgel inks is created that allows for tuning of void fraction from 0.20 to 0.57. Furthermore, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) seeded onto printed constructs are observed to migrate into granular inks in a void fraction-dependent manner. Thus, the family of microgel inks holds promise for use in 3D printing and tissue engineering applications that rely upon cell infiltration.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

For the most part, however, the gold catalyst does not change oxidation state during the course of these processes and two-electron redox cycles of the kind implicated in cross-coupling chemistry are not easily accessible. In order to address this limitation and expand the scope of gold catalysis beyond conventional hydrofunctionalization, extensive efforts have been made to develop new oxidative reactions using strong external oxidants capable of overcoming the high potential of the AuI/AuIII redox couple. However, these processes typically require superstoichiometric amounts of the oxidant and proceed under relatively harsh conditions. Moreover, to date, gold-catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions have remained somewhat limited in scope because, for many systems, the desired cross-coupling does not favorably compete with homodimerization or conventional hydrofunctionalization.In 2013, we disclosed a new concept for gold-catalyzed coupling reactions that, rather than involving external oxidants, employs aryl radicals that act as both the oxidant and the coupling partner in overall redox-neutral transformations. For this, we developed a dual catalytic system combining homogeneous gold catalysis with the emerging field of visible light photoredox catalysis. Using aryldiazonium salts, which are known to act as sources of aryl radicals upon activation with reducing photocatalysts, we could achieve intramolecular oxy- and aminoarylations of alkenes upon irradiating the reaction mixtures with visible light. Further studies on this transformation, in which nucleophilic addition onto a gold-activated alkene is followed by C(sp3)–C(sp2) bond formation, expanded the scope of the process to intermolecular, three-component oxyarylation, while inexpensive organic dyes and user-friendly diaryliodonium salts could be employed as alternative photocatalysts and aryl radical sources, respectively.The potential of dual gold/photoredox catalysis was quickly realized by several research groups and a range of diverse new coupling reactions involving nucleophilic addition to π-systems and even P–H and C(sp)–H functionalization have been developed. In addition to the ambient reaction conditions and the simple setup using household light sources or even sunlight, a key advantage of dual gold/photoredox catalysis results from the simultaneous oxidation of gold(I) and coordination of the coupling partner, which results in high levels of selectivity for the cross-coupled products over homodimers. Furthermore, when gold complexes that are not catalytically active prior to oxidation by the aryl radical are employed, background reactions not involving coupling can be suppressed. Notably, this feature has allowed for the successful use of allenes and alkynes, for which conventional hydrofunctionalization pathways are highly favored, opening the door to new transformations involving the most common substrate classes for gold catalysis. In this Account, we provide an overview of dual gold/photoredox catalysis and highlight the potential of this concept to greatly expand the scope of homogeneous gold catalysis and enable the efficient construction of complex organic molecules. Moreover, recent studies on the visible light-promoted synthesis of novel gold(III) complexes suggest that photoredox activation could yet find further applications in gold chemistry beyond coupling.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In this work, single atoms of palladium and platinum supported on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), i.e., Pd/g-C3N4 and Pt/g-C3N4, respectively, acting as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction were investigated by density functional theory calculations for the first time. During CO2 reduction, the individual metal atoms function as the active sites, while g-C3N4 provides the source of hydrogen (H*) from the hydrogen evolution reaction. The complete, as-designed photocatalysts exhibit excellent activity in CO2 reduction. HCOOH is the preferred product of CO2 reduction on the Pd/g-C3N4 catalyst with a rate-determining barrier of 0.66 eV, while the Pt/g-C3N4 catalyst prefers to reduce CO2 to CH4 with a rate-determining barrier of 1.16 eV. In addition, deposition of atom catalysts on g-C3N4 significantly enhances the visible-light absorption, rendering them ideal for visible-light reduction of CO2. Our findings open a new avenue of CO2 reduction for renewable energy supply.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The ability to tune their bandgap by alloying various halide anions (for example, in CH3NH3Pb(I1–xBrx)3, 0 < x < 1) is however hampered by the reversible photoinduced formation of sub-bandgap emissive states. We find that ion segregation takes place via halide defects, resulting in iodide-rich low-bandgap regions close to the illuminated surface of the film. This segregation may be driven by the strong gradient in carrier generation rate through the thickness of these strongly absorbing materials. Once returned to the dark, entropically driven intermixing of halides returns the system to a homogeneous condition. We present approaches to suppress this process by controlling either the internal light distribution or the defect density within the film. These results are relevant to stability in both single- and mixed-halide perovskites, leading the way toward tunable and stable perovskite thin films for photovoltaic and light-emitting applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The long‐lived phosphorescence of a series of Au I arylethynyl complexes with tunable emission energies in aerated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solutions can be completely and repeatedly switched on by controlled photoirradiation. A trace amount of DMSO oxidation by the sensitized singlet oxygen is proposed to lead to a depletion of molecular oxygen in the local microenvironment of the Au I phosphor in the photoactivation processes. Harnessing the photoactivated phosphorescence and using UV light as a non‐contact pen, a writing–erasing–rewriting prototype has been demonstrated with a DMSO gel containing Au I arylethynyl complexes.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Use of light to drive polymerization has advantages by imparting spatial and temporal control over the reaction. Photoinduced electron/energy transfer reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (PET-RAFT) has emerged as an excellent technique for developing well-defined polymers from a variety of functional monomers. However, the mechanism, of electron versus energy transfer is debated in the literature, with conflicting reports on the underlying process. This perspective focuses on the mechanistic aspects of PET-RAFT, in particular, the electron versus energy transfer pathways. The different mechanisms are evaluated, including evidence for one versus the other mechanisms. The current literature has not reached a consensus across all PET-RAFT processes, but rather, each catalytic system has unique characteristics.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Industrial production of nanocelluloses is increasing rapidly with several companies already producing on the tons-per-day scale, intensifying the quest for viable products across many sectors. While the hydrophilicity of the nanocellulose interface has posed a challenge to the use of CNCs and CNFs as reinforcing agents in conventional plastics, it is a significant benefit for creating reinforced or structured hydrogel composites (or, when dried, aerogels) exhibiting both mechanical reinforcement and a host of other desirable properties. In this context, this Review describes the quickly growing field of hydrogels and aerogels incorporating nanocelluloses; over 200 references are summarized in comprehensive tables covering the chemistry, preparation, properties, and applications of \"nanocellulose-only\" and \"nanocellulose-containing\" gels. Physical and chemical cross-linking strategies, postmodification steps, and routes to control gel structure are discussed, along with key developments and ongoing challenges in the field. Nanocellulose hydrogels and aerogels show great promise in a wide range of biomedical, energy storage, construction, separations, cosmetic, and food applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Since the pioneering work in 2009 on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) for visible-light photocatalytic water splitting, g-C3N4 -based photocatalysis has become a very hot research topic. This review summarizes the recent progress regarding the design and preparation of g-C3N4 -based photocatalysts, including the fabrication and nanostructure design of pristine g-C3N4 , bandgap engineering through atomic-level doping and molecular-level modification, and the preparation of g-C3N4 -based semiconductor composites. Also, the photo-catalytic applications of g-C3N4 -based photocatalysts in the fields of water splitting, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, organic syntheses, and bacterial disinfection are reviewed, with emphasis on photocatalysis promoted by carbon materials, non-noble-metal cocatalysts, and Z-scheme heterojunctions. Finally, the concluding remarks are presented and some perspectives regarding the future development of g-C3N4 -based photocatalysts are highlighted.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here, the feasibility of replacing the critical fluorine substituents in high-performance photovoltaic polymer donors with chlorine is demonstrated, and two polymeric donors, PBDB-T-2F and PBDB-T-2Cl, are synthesized and compared in parallel. The synthesis of PBDB-T-2Cl is much simpler than that of PBDB-T-2F. The two polymers have very similar optoelectronic and morphological properties, except the chlorinated polymer possess lower molecular energy levels than the fluorinated one. As a result, the PBDB-T-2Cl-based PSCs exhibit higher open circuit voltage (Voc ) than the PBDB-T-2F-based devices, leading to an outstanding power conversion efficiency of over 14%. This work establishes a more economical design paradigm of replacing fluorine with chlorine for preparing highly efficient polymer donors.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The aim of this study is to prepare new antibacterial UV-cured networks by using a thiol-ene formulation with covalent immobilization of monoterpenes as antibacterial agents and without any organic solvent thanks to the solvent-like properties of linalool. The challenge was to demonstrate the advantage of using linalool as a chemical platform molecule and, at the same time, as an antibacterial agent. The incorporation of linear linalool to the rigid isosorbide moiety generates flexible networks. Different networks were prepared by varying the mass ratio of linalool (from 0 to 100% w/w) mixed into the coating and then characterized. Their antibacterial activities were investigated in vitro against two pathogenic bacteria strains: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The results have shown a promising antiadherence for S. aureus without any diffusion of linalool that will allow potential applications of terpenes coatings for antibacterial adhesion.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of a series of novel PIs, containing coumarin moieties as chromophores and oxime ester groups as initiation functionalities and explore their structure–activity relationship.

The surface properties were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), water contact angle, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The antibacterial and release properties of the surfaces were tested against E. coli: at 37 °C (above the LCST of PNIPAAm), the functional films facilitated the attachment of bacteria, which were then killed by the AgNPs. Changing temperature to 4 °C (below the LCST), swollen PNIPAAm chains led the release of dead bacteria.

We designed Pickering oil-in-water emulsions using whey protein microgels by a facile route of heat-set gel formation followed by mechanical shear and studied the influence of heat treatment on emulsions stabilized by these particles. The aim of this study was to compare the barrier properties of the microgel particles and heat-treated fused microgel particles at the oil-water interface in delaying the digestion of the emulsified lipids using an in vitro digestion model. A combination of transmission electron microscopy and surface coverage measurements revealed an increased coverage of heat-treated microgel particles at the interface. The heat-induced microgel particle aggregation and, therefore, a fused network at the oil-water interface were more beneficial to delay the rate of digestion in the presence of pure lipase and bile salts compared to intact whey protein microgel particles, as shown by the measurements of zeta potential and free fatty acid release, plus theoretical calculations. However, simulated gastric digestion with pepsin impacted significantly on such barrier effects, due to the proteolysis of the particle network at the interface irrespective of the heat treatment, as visualized using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis measurements.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Although there are many such important reactions, this contribution focuses on the fundamental aspects of photocatalytic water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen by using light from the solar spectrum, which is one of the most investigated photosynthetic reactions. Photocatalytic water splitting using solar energy is considered to be artificial photosynthesis that produces a solar fuel because the reaction mimics nature's photosynthesis not only in its redox reaction type but also in its thermodynamics (water splitting: 1.23 eV vs glucose formation: 1.24 eV). To achieve efficient photocatalytic water splitting, all of the parameters, though involved at different time scales and spatial resolutions, should be optimized because the overall efficiency is obtained as the multiplication of all these fundamental efficiencies. The purpose of this Review is to provide the guidelines of a concept, \"photocatalysis by design\", which is the opposite of \"black box screening\"; this concept refers to making quantitative descriptions of the associated physical and chemical properties to determine which events/parameters have the most impact on improving the overall photocatalytic performance, in contrast to arbitrarily ranking different photocatalyst materials. First, the properties that can be quantitatively measured or calculated are identified. Second, the quantities of these identified properties are determined by performing adequate measurements and/or calculations. Third, the obtained values of these properties are integrated into equations so that the kinetic/energetic bottlenecks of specific properties/processes can be determined, and the properties can then be altered to further improve the process. Accumulation of knowledge ranging in fields from solid-state physics to electrochemistry and the use of a multidisciplinary approach to conduct measurements and modeling in a quantitative manner are required to fully understand and improve the efficiency of photocatalysis.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here, a novel strategy is exhibited to enhance the adhesiveness of hydrogels by introducing positively charged microgel into the hydrogel matrix of polydopamine inspired by the natural mussel adhesive mechanism. The synthesized hydrogels exhibit good adhesion not only on various organic and inorganic surfaces (such as polythene, polytetrafluoroethylene, rubber, ceramics, glass, and copper) but also on many biological tissue surfaces (e.g., heart, liver, lung, kidney, and hogskin). Compared with hydrogels only containing catechol moieties, the adhesion strength of microgel-containing hydrogels increased 8 times on glass substrates. In addition, the adhesive hydrogel also exhibits rapid self-healing and good stretchability due to the noncovalent interaction between the microgel and the hydrogel matrix. On the whole, doping microgel in the construction of multifunctional hydrogels substantially improved their adhesive ability on many types of surfaces.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

We explore a concept based on the nanoconfinement of polymers to substantially improve the stretchability of polymer semiconductors, without affecting charge transport mobility. The increased polymer chain dynamics under nanoconfinement significantly reduces the modulus of the conjugated polymer and largely delays the onset of crack formation under strain. As a result, our fabricated semiconducting film can be stretched up to 100% strain without affecting mobility, retaining values comparable to that of amorphous silicon. The fully stretchable transistors exhibit high biaxial stretchability with minimal change in on current even when poked with a sharp object. We demonstrate a skinlike finger-wearable driver for a light-emitting diode.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

To this end, a binary nanohybrid (BP/CN) of two-dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) and graphitic carbon nitride (CN) was designed and used as a metal-free photocatalyst for the first time. During irradiation of BP/CN in water with >420 and >780 nm light, solid H2 gas was generated, respectively. Owing to the interfacial interaction between BP and CN, efficient charge transfer occurred, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance. The efficient charge-trapping and transfer processes were thoroughly investigated with time-resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopic measurement. The present results show that BP/CN is a metal-free photocatalyst for artificial photosynthesis and renewable energy conversion.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Recently, major achievements in the development of high‐performance photoinitiating systems based on organic dyes as light‐harvesting compounds and their uses as photoinitiators for photopolymerization under visible‐light irradiation have clearly emerged, giving rise to abundant literature. In this review, an overview of the recently synthesized chromophores belonging to various families of organic dyes and used as photoinitiators of polymerization during the 2018–2021 period are presented and classified. Recent works have resulted in the development of new chromophores exhibiting remarkable visible light absorption properties and excellent photoinitiation abilities upon irradiation with LEDs and/or sunlight in free radical photopolymerization processes. These developments notably indicate that sunlight has the advantages of being a cheap, unlimited, broad emission spectrum, and energy‐saving light source capable to be an efficient substitute to artificial light sources. The newly developed dye‐based photoinitiating systems designed to initiate visible‐light‐induced photopolymerization processes are likely to expand the scope of application of photopolymerization in modern sciences and technologies.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Due to their complex morphology, their interactions and packing, and consequentially the viscoelasticity of suspensions made from microgels, are still not fully understood, in particular under dense packing conditions. Here we study the frequency-dependent linear viscoelastic properties of dense suspensions of micron sized soft particles in conjunction with an analysis of the local particle structure and morphology based on superresolution microscopy. By identifying the dominating mechanisms that control the elastic and dissipative response, we can explain the rheology of these widely studied soft particle assemblies from the onset of elasticity deep into the overpacked regime. Interestingly, our results suggest that the friction between the microgels is reduced due to lubrification mediated by the polymer brush-like corona before the onset of interpenetration.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Several key challenges hinder their application as coating materials for blood-contacting biomedical devices, including weak mechanical strength and low adhesion to the substrate. Here, we report a poly(carboxybetaine) microgel reinforced poly(sulfobetaine) (pCBM/pSB) pure zwitterionic hydrogel with excellent mechanical robustness and anti-swelling properties. The pCBM/pSB hydrogel coating was bonded to the PVC substrate via the entanglement network between the pSB and PVC chain. Moreover, the pCBM/pSB hydrogel coating can maintain favorable stability even after 21 d PBS shearing, 0.5 h strong water flushing, 1000 underwater bends, and 100 sandpaper abrasions.

Their softness and the potential to respond to external stimuli like temperature, pressure, pH, ionic strength, and different analytes make them interesting as soft model systems in fundamental research as well as for a broad range of applications, in particular in the field of biological applications. Recent tremendous developments in their synthesis open access to systems with complex architectures and compositions allowing for tailoring microgels with specific properties. At the same time state-of-the-art theoretical and simulation approaches offer deeper understanding of the behavior and structure of nano- and microgels under external influences and confinement at interfaces or at high volume fractions. Developments in the experimental analysis of nano- and microgels have become particularly important for structural investigations covering a broad range of length scales relevant to the internal structure, the overall size and shape, and interparticle interactions in concentrated samples. Here we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art, recent developments as well as emerging trends in the field of nano- and microgels. The following aspects build the focus of our discussion: tailoring (multi)functionality through synthesis; the role in biological and biomedical applications; the structure and properties as a model system, e.g., for densely packed arrangements in bulk and at interfaces; as well as the theory and computer simulation.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Adsorption is driven by a reduction of the total free energy as the contact area between the two liquids is partially replaced by the particle. From an application point of view, particle-stabilized interfaces form emulsions and foams with superior stability. Liquid interfaces also effectively confine colloidal particles in two dimensions and therefore provide ideal model systems to fundamentally study particle interactions, dynamics, and self-assembly. With progress in the synthesis of nanomaterials, more and more complex and functional particles are available for such studies. In this Account, we focus on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) nanogels and microgels. These are cross-linked polymeric particles that swell and soften by uptaking large amounts of water. The incorporated water can be partially expelled, causing a volume phase transition into a collapsed state when the temperature is increased above approximately 32 °C. Soft microgels adsorbed to liquid interfaces significantly deform under the influence of interfacial tension and assume cross sections exceeding their bulk dimensions. In particular, a pronounced corona forms around the microgel core, consisting of dangling chains at the microgel periphery. These polymer chains expand at the interface and strongly affect the interparticle interactions. The particle deformability therefore leads to a significantly more complex interfacial phase behavior that provides a rich playground to explore structure formation processes. We first discuss the characteristic \"fried-egg\" or core-corona morphology of individual microgels adsorbed to a liquid interface and comment on the dependence of this interfacial morphology on their physicochemical properties. We introduce different theoretical models to describe their interfacial morphology. In a second part, we introduce how ensembles of microgels interact and self-assemble at liquid interfaces. The core-corona morphology and the possibility to force these elements into overlap upon compression results in a complex phase behavior with a phase transition between microgels with extended and collapsed coronae. We discuss the influence of the internal particle architecture, also including core-shell microgels with rigid cores, on the phase behavior. Finally, we present new routes for the realization of more complex structures, resulting from multiple deposition protocols and from engineering the interaction potential of the individual particles.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Despite the recent progress in controlled/\"living\" radical polymerization, polymer chemists do not have the ability to tune and manipulate the shape of molecular weight distributions (MWDs) (except for a few recent examples). In this article, new synthetic procedures have been developed for controlling MWDs using photoinduced electron/energy transfer–reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization, in conjunction with flow processes. By adjusting the pump flow rates, the chemical concentrations and residence times of the reactant streams were tailored throughout the polymerization, leading to control over the MWD. Changes to the intensity and wavelength of the light source also induced changes in the polymerization, allowing alteration of the MWD.

Thus, expensive and destructive electron microscopy (EM) has been commonly used to examine the morphologies of nanostructures. Further, while nanoscale fluorescence OM has become crucial for investigating the morphologies and functions of intracellular specimens, this modality is not suitable for imaging optical absorption and requires the use of possibly undesirable exogenous fluorescent molecules for biological samples. Here we demonstrate super-resolution visible photoactivated atomic force microscopy (pAFM), which can sense intrinsic optical absorption with ~8 nm resolution. Thus, the resolution can be improved down to ~8 nm. This system can detect not only the first harmonic response, but also the higher harmonic response using the nonlinear effect. The thermoelastic effects induced by pulsed laser irradiation allow us to obtain visible pAFM images of single gold nanospheres, various nanowires, and biological cells, all with nanoscale resolution. Unlike expensive EM, the visible pAFM system can be simply implemented by adding an optical excitation sub-system to a commercial atomic force microscope.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Whereas hydrogels have been made tough to resist fracture under a single cycle of mechanical load, these toughened gels still suffer from fatigue fracture under multiple cycles of loads. The reported fatigue threshold for synthetic hydrogels is on the order of 1 to 100 J/m2. We propose that designing anti-fatigue-fracture hydrogels requires making the fatigue crack encounter and fracture objects with energies per unit area much higher than that for fracturing a single layer of polymer chains. We demonstrate that the controlled introduction of crystallinity in hydrogels can substantially enhance their anti-fatigue-fracture properties. The fatigue threshold of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with a crystallinity of 18.9 weight % in the swollen state can exceed 1000 J/m2.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

While their band gap can be tuned by partial halide substitution, mixed halide perovskites often have lower open-circuit voltage than would be expected and experience photoinduced trap formation caused by halide segregation. We investigate solar cell performance and photostability across a compositional space of formamidinium (FA) and cesium (Cs) at the A-site at various halide compositions and show that using more Cs at the A-site rather than more Br at the X-site to raise band gap is more ideal as it improves both VOC and photostability. We develop band gap maps and design criteria for the selection of perovskite compositions within the CsxFA1–xPb(BryI1–y)3, space. With this, we identify perovskites with tandem-relevant band gaps of 1.68 and 1.75 eV that demonstrate high device efficiencies of 17.4 and 16.3%, respectively, and significantly improved photostability compared to that of the higher Br-containing compositions.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Industrial dyes are one of the dominant chemicals that make water unfit for drinking. Among these dyes, methylene blue (MB) is toxic, carcinogenic, and non-biodegradable and can cause a severe threat to human health and environmental safety. It is usually released in natural water sources, which becomes a health threat to human beings and living organisms. Hence, there is a need to develop an environmentally friendly, efficient technology for removing MB from wastewater. Photodegradation is an advanced oxidation process widely used for MB removal. It has the advantages of complete mineralization of dye into simple and nontoxic species with the potential to decrease the processing cost. This review provides a tutorial basis for the readers working in the dye degradation research area. We not only covered the basic principles of the process but also provided a wide range of previously published work on advanced photocatalytic systems (single-component and multi-component photocatalysts). Our study has focused on critical parameters that can affect the photodegradation rate of MB, such as photocatalyst type and loading, irradiation reaction time, pH of reaction media, initial concentration of dye, radical scavengers and oxidising agents. The photodegradation mechanism, reaction pathways, intermediate products, and final products of MB are also summarized.

Although well characterized in bulk, it remains unclear how the phase transition is affected by the presence of a confining interface. Here, we demonstrate that the temperature-induced volume phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels, conventionally considered an intrinsic molecular property of the polymer, is in fact largely suppressed when the microgel is adsorbed to an air/liquid interface. We further observe a hysteresis in the core morphology and interfacial pressure between heating and cooling cycles. Our results, supported by molecular dynamics simulations, reveal that the dangling polymer chains of microgel particles, spread at the interface under the influence of surface tension, do not undergo any volume phase transition. The balance in free energy responsible for the volume phase transition is fundamentally altered by interfacial confinement. These results imply that important technological properties of such systems, including the temperature-induced destabilization of emulsions, do not occur via a decrease in the interfacial coverage of the microgels.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, the fabrication of conducting polymers has mostly relied on conventional approaches such as ink-jet printing, screen printing, and electron-beam lithography, whose limitations have hampered rapid innovations and broad applications of conducting polymers. Here we introduce a high-performance 3D printable conducting polymer ink based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) for 3D printing of conducting polymers. The resultant superior printability enables facile fabrication of conducting polymers into high resolution and high aspect ratio microstructures, which can be integrated with other materials such as insulating elastomers via multi-material 3D printing. The 3D-printed conducting polymers can also be converted into highly conductive and soft hydrogel microstructures. We further demonstrate fast and streamlined fabrications of various conducting polymer devices, such as a soft neural probe capable of in vivo single-unit recording.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The last few years have seen transformative advances in achieving strong hydrogel adhesion, which is a supramolecular phenomenon. Two adherends connect through covalent bonds, noncovalent complexes, polymer chains, polymer networks, or nanoparticles. Separating the adherends dissipates energy through cascading events across length scales, including bond cleavage, chain retraction, and bulk hysteresis. A unifying principle has emerged: strong hydrogel adhesion requires the synergy of chemistry of bonds, topology of connection, and mechanics of dissipation. This synergy characterizes hydrogel adhesion to various materials (another hydrogel, tissue, elastomer, plastic, metal, glass, and ceramic) in various operations (cast, coat, print, attach, pierce, and glue). Strong adhesion can be made permanent, reversible, degradable, or on‐demand detachable. The development of hydrogel adhesion and its applications adheres disciplines, discovers interlinks, and forges cohesion. Discussed throughout the review are immediate opportunities for fundamental studies and practical applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Excellent polymerization initiating abilities are found, and high final reactive function conversions are obtained. Interestingly, these new derivatives exhibit much better visible light polymerization initiating ability compared to a reference UV-absorbing carbazole (CARET, 9H-carbazole-9-ethanol) showing that the new substituents are of great interest to red-shift the absorption of the proposed photoinitiators.

While DNA-AuNP conjugates, such as nanoflares, have been used for single and multiple mRNA molecules detection in living cells, the target recognition reaction is triggered once they enter into cells, making it impossible to control the initial reaction at the desired time. To solve this problem, we have designed photoactivated (PA) nanoflares for intracellular mRNA analysis with high spatiotemporal control. PA nanoflares consist of AuNP and photoresponsive DNA hairpin probes. Without UV irradiation, the DNA hairpin could be kept unawakened and show no reactivity to target the probe. Upon UV activation, the hairpin structures are destroyed and expose the sticky domains, which act as toeholds to mediate strand displacement reactions, making flares release from the gold surface and causing an increase of fluorescence. By tuning light irradiation, PA nanoflares for mRNA detection in living cells can be temporally controlled. With the benefit from two-photon laser illumination, PA nanoflares can detect mRNA in selective cells at a desired time point at the single-cell level. Compared to the traditional nanoflares, the novel PA nanoflares have increased the detection sensitivity and achieved intracellular biomarkers detection at the single-cell level with high spatiotemporal control.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

An evolving approach to address these limitations is the fabrication of hydrogel microparticles (i.e., \"microgels\") that can be assembled into granular hydrogels. There are numerous methods to fabricate microgels; however, the influence of the fabrication technique on granular hydrogel properties is unexplored. Herein, we investigated the influence of three microgel fabrication techniques (microfluidic devices (MD), batch emulsions (BE), and mechanical fragmentation by extrusion (EF)) on the resulting granular hydrogel properties (e.g., mechanics, porosity, and injectability). Hyaluronic acid (HA) modified with various reactive groups (i.e., norbornenes (NorHA), pentenoates (HA-PA), and methacrylates (MeHA)) were used to form microgels with an average diameter of ∼100 μm. The MD method resulted in homogeneous spherical microgels, the BE method resulted in heterogeneous spherical microgels, and the EF method resulted in heterogeneous polygonal microgels. Across the various reactive groups, microgels fabricated with the MD and BE methods had lower functional group consumption when compared to microgels fabricated with the EF method.

This critical review presents the recent advances and progress in the design and synthesis of various CdS and CdS-based photocatalysts. The basic physical and chemical properties of CdS and the related growth mechanism have been briefly summarized. Moreover, the applications of CdS-based photocatalysts have been discussed such as in photocatalytic hydrogen production, reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbon fuels and degradation of pollutants.

Cisplatin is always in first‐line treatment of NSCLC; however, cisplatin resistance restricts the application in the clinic. Herein, an innovative 2D platinum delivery platform based on manganese dioxide nanosheet is presented to overcome cisplatin‐resistance and enhance theranostic efficacy in NSCLC. The photo‐induced hyperthermia of nanosheets can inhibit Pt drug efflux from the multidrug resistance‐associated protein (MRP1) repression. Then the intracellular l ‐Glutathione (GSH) consumed by MnO 2 nanosheets can reduce the generation of GSH‐Pt complex. Working along both lines accelerates access to the nucleus for cisplatin. Moreover, chemo‐photothermal synergistic therapy of Pt nanosheets significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo. In addition, nanosheets can exert an on‐demand activable magnetic resonance imaging contrast effect to monitor Pt drug release. For the first time, a promising photoactivated 2D vector is provided to overcome cisplatin resistance in NSCLC therapy.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Fawcett et al. show that visible light can induce replacement of carboxylic acid groups with boronate esters, which will ease their introduction into a wide variety of compounds. Once the acids are activated with phthalimide substituents, they can react with catecholborane dimers under illumination in amide solvents, with no need for catalysts or other additives. The reaction appears to proceed by radical chain propagation after photoinitiation.

For instance, mixed halide hybrid perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronics, yet bulk measurements suggest the halides reversibly phase separate upon photoexcitation. By combining nanoscale imaging and multiscale modeling, we find that the nature of halide demixing in these materials is distinct from macroscopic phase separation. We propose that the localized strain induced by a single photoexcited charge interacting with the soft, ionic lattice is sufficient to promote halide phase separation and nucleate a light-stabilized, low-bandgap, ∼8 nm iodide-rich cluster. The limited extent of this polaron is essential to promote demixing because by contrast bulk strain would simply be relaxed. Photoinduced phase separation is therefore a consequence of the unique electromechanical properties of this hybrid class of materials. Exploiting photoinduced phase separation and other nonequilibrium phenomena in hybrid materials more generally could expand applications in sensing, switching, memory, and energy storage.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

As such, PACT represents a major scientific opportunity for developing new bioactive inorganic compounds. However, the societal impact of this approach will only take off if the PACT field is used to address real societal challenges, i.e., therapeutic questions that make sense in a clinical context, rather than purely chemical questions. In particular, I advocate here that the field has become mature enough to switch from a compound-based approach, where a particular cancer model is chosen only to demonstrate the utility of a compound, to a disease-based approach, where the question of which disease to cure comes first: which PACT compound should I make to solve that particular clinical problem?

Here we report a new paradigm for the fabrication of self-assembled hydrogels with shear-thinning and self-healing properties employing rationally engineered polymer-nanoparticle (NP) interactions. Biopolymer derivatives are linked together by selective adsorption to NPs. The transient and reversible interactions between biopolymers and NPs enable flow under applied shear stress, followed by rapid self-healing when the stress is relaxed. We develop a physical description of polymer-NP gel formation that is utilized to design biocompatible gels for drug delivery. Owing to the hierarchical structure of the gel, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs can be entrapped and delivered with differential release profiles, both in vitro and in vivo.

This catalytic strategy enables the generation of various reactive species, frequently without stoichiometric activation reagents under mild reaction conditions. Manipulation of these reactive intermediates can result in numerous synthetically useful bond formations in a controllable manner.In this Account, we describe our recent advances in the rational design and strategic application of photocatalysis in the synthesis of various synthetically and biologically important heterocycles. Our main research efforts toward this goal can be classified into four categories: formal cycloaddition and cyclization reactions, radical-mediated olefin functionalization/cyclization cascades, photocatalytic generation and cyclization of N-centered radicals, and photocatalytic functionalization of heterocycles by visible-light-induced dual catalysis. Inspired by the wide application of tertiary amines as reductive additives in photoredox catalysis, we exploited a series of readily accessible or rationally designed tertiary amines with reactive sites in a range of photocatalytic formal cycloaddition and cyclization reactions, providing efficient access to diverse nitrogen heterocycles. Employing various photogenerated radical species, we further developed a series of radical-mediated olefin functionalization/cyclization cascade reactions to successfully assemble various five- and six-membered heterocycles. We have also achieved for the first time the direct catalytic conversion of recalcitrant N–H bonds into neutral N-centered radicals through a visible-light-photocatalytic oxidative deprotonation electron transfer. Using this generic strategy, we have devised several types of radical cyclizations of unsaturated hydrazones, leading to the construction of diversely functionalized pyrazoline and pyridazine derivatives in good yields and selectivity. Moreover, we have demonstrated that this photocatalysis can serve as a mild and highly selective tool for direct functionalization of heterocycles because of its powerful capability to controllably generate diverse reactive intermediates under mild reaction conditions. Guided by the fundamental principles of photocatalysis and the redox properties of the photocatalysts, we successfully developed an array of dual-catalyst systems by combining the photocatalysts with palladium, nickel, or amine, enabling efficient and selective coupling reactions. An intriguing phototandem catalytic system using a single photocatalyst was also identified for the development of cascade reactions. Notably, some of the newly developed methodologies have also been successfully utilized for late-stage modification of biologically active natural compounds and complex molecules and as key steps for formal synthesis of natural products.This Account presents a panoramic view and the logic of our recent contributions to the design, development, and application of photocatalytic systems and reactions that provide not only methods for the efficient synthesis of heterocycles but also useful insights into the exploration of new photochemical reactions.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The photochemical mechanisms are investigated by fluorescence, cyclic voltammetry, laser flash photolysis, electron spin resonance spin trapping, and steady state photolysis techniques. The generated reactive species are capable of initiating the cationic polymerization (CP) of epoxides under air or the free radical polymerization (FRP) of acrylates in laminate upon exposure to visible lights delivered by a halogen lamp, a cold white light‐emitting diode (LED), or LEDs at 385, 395, 405, 455, or 470 nm. Compared to the well‐known camphorquinone based systems, the novel NDA containing PISs exhibit higher efficiencies both for CP and FRP. Remarkably, the photo­bleaching of some NDAs is significant, and colorless final polymer coatings are obtained. The structure/photochemical property relationships of NDAs are discussed in detail (redox potentials, fluorescence, rate constants of reactions, etc.) to shed some light on their respective photoinitiating ability. image\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Among them, rhodamine spirolactams exhibit great superiority for PALM imaging due to a desirable bright–dark contrast during the photochromic switching process. Although considerable attention has been paid to the chemical modifications on rhodamine spirolactams, the on-time of photochromic switching, one of the key characteristics for PALM imaging, has never been optimized in previous developments. In this study, we proposed that simply installing a carboxyl group close to the lactam site could impose an intramolecular acidic environment, stabilize the photoactivated zwitterionic structure, and thus effectively increase the on-time. On the basis of this idea, we have synthesized a new rhodamine spirolactam, Rh-Gly, that demonstrated considerably longer on-time than the other tested analogues, as well as an enhancement of single-molecule brightness, an improvement on signal-to-noise ratio and an enlargement of total collected photons of a single molecule before photobleaching. Finally, super-resolution images of live cell mitochondria stained with Rh-Gly have been obtained with a good temporal resolution of 10 s, as well as a satisfactory localization precision of ∼25 nm. Through self-labeling protein tags, Rh-Gly modified with a HaloTag ligand enabled super-resolution imaging of histone H2B proteins in live HeLa cells; through immunostaining antibodies labeled with an isothiocyanate-substituted Rh-Gly, super-resolution imaging of microtubules was achieved in fixed cells. Therefore, our simple and effective strategy provides novel insight for developing further enhanced rhodamine spirolactams recommendable for PALM imaging.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In particular, microgels, consisting of a cross-linked polymer network, are able to deform and flatten upon adsorption at the interface due to the balance between surface tension and internal elasticity. Despite the existence of experimental results, a detailed theoretical understanding of this phenomenon is still lacking due to the absence of appropriate microscopic models. In this work, we propose an advanced modeling of microgels at a flat water/oil interface. The model builds on a realistic description of the internal polymeric architecture and single-particle properties of the microgel and is able to reproduce its experimentally observed shape at the interface. Complementing molecular dynamics simulations with in situ cryo-electron microscopy experiments and atomic force microscopy imaging after Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, we compare the morphology of the microgels for different values of the cross-linking ratios. Our model allows for a systematic microscopic investigation of soft particles at fluid interfaces, which is essential to develop predictive power for the use of microgels in a broad range of applications, including the stabilization of smart emulsions and the versatile patterning of surfaces.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Nonetheless, attempts to improve its inherently low activity are rarely based on rational approaches due to a lack of fundamental understanding of its mechanistic operation. Here, we employ molecular heptazine-based model catalysts to identify the cyanamide moiety as a photocatalytically relevant \"defect\". We exploit this knowledge for the rational design of a carbon nitride polymer populated with cyanamide groups, yielding a material with 12- and 16-times the hydrogen evolution rate and apparent quantum efficiency (400 nm), respectively, compared to the benchmark melon. Computational modelling and material characterization suggest this moiety improves co-ordination (and, in turn, charge transfer kinetics) to the platinum co-catalyst and enhances the separation of the photo-generated charge carriers. The demonstrated knowledge transfer for rational catalyst design presented here provides the conceptual framework for engineering high performance heptazine-based photocatalysts.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In this sandwich architecture, the double-layer electric field at the Li/polymer interface is reduced due to the blocked salt anion transfer. The polymer layer adheres/wets the lithium metal surface and makes the Li-ion flux at the interface more homogeneous. This structure integrates the advantages of the ceramic and polymer. With the PCPSE, all-solid-state Li/LiFePO4 cells showed a notably high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8-100% over 640 cycles.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

To overcome this obstacle, a new photoactive sorafenib-Ru(II) complex Ru-Sora has been designed. Upon irradiation (λ = 465 nm), Ru-Sora rapidly releases sorafenib and generates reactive oxygen species, which can oxidize intracellular substances such as GSH. Cellular experiments show that irradiated Ru-Sora is highly cytotoxic toward Hep-G2 cells, including sorafenib-resistant Hep-G2-SR cells. Compared to sorafenib, Ru-Sora has a significant photoactivated chemotherapeutic effect against Hep-G2-SR cancer cells and 3D Hep-G2 multicellular tumor spheroids. Furthermore, Ru-Sora inducing apoptosis and ferroptosis is proved by GSH depletion, GPX4 downregulation, and lipid peroxide accumulation. Metabolomics results suggest that Ru-Sora exerts photocytotoxicity by disrupting the purine metabolism, which is expected to inhibit tumor development. This study provides a promising strategy for enhancing chemotherapy and combating drug-resistant HCC disease.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Whether impaired lysosomal acidification is causally inhibiting autophagic flux and cellular functions could not, up to the present, be determined because of the lack of an approach to modify lysosomal acidity. To address this question, lysosome-localizing nanoparticles are described that, upon UV photoactivation, enable controlled acidification of impaired lysosomes. The photoactivatable, acidifying nanoparticles (paNPs) demonstrate lysosomal uptake in INS1 and mouse β-cells. Photoactivation of paNPs in fatty acid–treated INS1 cells enhances lysosomal acidity and function while decreasing p62 and LC3-II levels, indicating rescue of autophagic flux upon acute lysosomal acidification. Furthermore, paNPs improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that is reduced under lipotoxicity in INS1 cells and mouse islets. These results establish a causative role for impaired lysosomal acidification in the deregulation of autophagy and β-cell function under lipotoxicity.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, self-healing hydrogels generally either possess mechanically robust or rapid self-healing properties but not both. Hence, the development of a mechanically robust hydrogel material with autonomous self-healing on the time scale of seconds is yet to be fully realized. Here, the current advances in the development of autonomous self-healing hydrogels are reviewed. Specifically, methods to test self-healing efficiencies and recoveries, mechanisms of autonomous self-healing, and mechanically robust hydrogels are presented. The trends indicate that hydrogels that self-heal better also achieve self-healing faster, as compared to gels that only partially self-heal. Recommendations to guide future development of self-healing hydrogels are offered and the potential relevance of self-healing hydrogels to the exciting research areas of 3D/4D printing, soft robotics, and assisted health technologies is highlighted.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

We investigate particles with different morphology, namely core-shell particles containing a solid silica core surrounded by a cross-linked polymer shell of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), and the corresponding hollow microgels where the core was dissolved. The polymer shell contains different amounts of cross-linker. The compression isotherms show that the removal of the core leads to an increase of the surface pressure at low compression, and the same effect can be observed when the polymer cross-link density is decreased. Low cross-link density and a missing core thus facilitate spreading of the polymer chains at the interface and, at high compression, hinder the transition to close hexagonal packing. Furthermore, the compression modulus only depends on the cross-link density at low compression, and no difference can be observed between the core-shell particles and the corresponding hollow microgels. It is especially remarkable that a low cross-link density leads to a high compression modulus at low compression, while this behavior is reversed at high compression. Thus, the core does not influence the particle behavior until the polymer shell is highly compressed and the core is directly exposed to the pressure. This is related to an enhanced spreading of polymer chains at the interface and thus high adsorption energy. These conclusions are fully supported by computer simulations which show that the cross-link density of the polymer shell defines the degree of deformation at the interface. Additionally, the core restricts the spreading of polymer chains at the interface. These results illustrate the special behavior of soft microgels at liquid interfaces.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In modern day communication systems, the most popular frequency band is Radio Frequency (RF) mainly due to little interference and good coverage. However, the rapidly dwindling RF spectrum along with increasing wireless network traffic has substantiated the need for greater bandwidth and spectral relief. By combining illumination and communication, VLC provides ubiquitous communication while addressing the shortfalls and limitations of RF communication. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on VLC with an emphasis on challenges faced in indoor applications over the period 1979-2014. VLC is compared with infrared (IR) and RF systems and the necessity for using this beneficial technology in communication systems is justified. The advantages of LEDs compared to traditional lighting technologies are discussed and comparison is done between different types of LEDs currently available. Modulation schemes and dimming techniques for indoor VLC are discussed in detail. Methods needed to improve VLC system performance such as filtering, equalization, compensation, and beamforming are also presented. The recent progress made by various research groups in this field is discussed along with the possible applications of this technology. Finally, the limitations of VLC as well as the probable future directions are presented.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Polymers containing various ratios of photodimerizable diaminoanthracene monomers and thermally exchangeable diaminoalkyl monomers linked by a common bisacetoacetate group are studied. It is demonstrated that alkyl amines undergo the necessary thermal exchange reactions for vinylogous urethane vitrimers, while aromatic amines do not. UV-induced dimerization of the anthracene units results in changes to the rheological properties and the glass transition temperature due to polymer cross-linking. Rapid and near-complete scratch healing upon heating is demonstrated, with a tunable onset temperature for healing controlled by UV irradiation. The viability of a composite vitrimeric system, wherein vitrimeric monomers are combined with non-vitrimeric, stimuli-responsive monomers to generate random copolymers with new properties, is demonstrated.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In this study, we designed aqueous dispersions of biocompatible whey-protein microgel particles (WPM) (10-80 vol %) cross-linked via disulfide bonding and focused on understanding their rheological, structural and biotribological properties (smooth polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) contacts, Ra < 50 nm, ball-on-disk set up). The WPM particles (Dh = 380 nm) displayed shear-thinning behavior and good lubricating performance in the plateau boundary as well as the mixed lubrication regimes. The WPM particles facilitated lubrication between bare hydrophobic PDMS surfaces (water contact angle 108°), leading to a 10-fold reduction in boundary friction force with increased volume fraction (ϕ ≥ 65%), largely attributed to the close packing-mediated layer of particles between the asperity contacts acting as \"true surface-separators\", hydrophobic moieties of WPM binding to the nonpolar surfaces, and particles employing a rolling mechanism analogous to \"ball bearings\", the latter supported by negligible change in size and microstructure of the WPM particles after tribology. An ultralow boundary friction coefficient, μ ≤ 0.03 was achieved using WPM between O2 plasma-treated hydrophilic PDMS contacts coated with bovine submaxillary mucin (water contact angle 47°), and electron micrographs revealed that the WPM particles spread effectively as a layer of particles even at low ϕ∼ 10%, forming a lubricating load-bearing film that prevented the two surfaces from true adhesive contact. However, above an optimum volume fraction, μ increased in HL+BSM surfaces due to the interpenetration of particles that possibly impeded effective rolling, explaining the slight increase in friction. These effects are reflected in the highly shear thinning nature of the WPM dispersions themselves plus the tendency for the apparent viscosity to fall as dispersions are forced to very high volume fractions. The present work demonstrates a novel approach for providing ultralow friction in soft polymeric surfaces using proteinaceous microgel particles that satisfy both load bearing and kinematic requirements. These findings hold great potential for designing biocompatible particles for aqueous lubrication in numerous soft matter applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

As in many other photochemical scenarios, the structural and energetic factors play relevant roles in determining the rates and efficiencies of PET and its competitive photodeactivation processes. Particularly, in the field of fluorescent sensors and switches, intramolecular PET is believed (in many cases without compelling experimental proof) to be responsible of the quench of fluorescence. There is an increasing experimental interest in fluorophore's molecular design and on achieving optimal excitation/emission spectra, excitation coefficients, and fluorescence quantum yields (importantly for bioimaging purposes), but less efforts are devoted to fundamental mechanistic studies. In this Account, I revise the origins of the fluorescence quenching in some of these systems with state-of-the-art quantum chemical tools. These studies go beyond the common strategy of analyzing frontier orbital energy diagrams and performing PET thermodynamics calculations. Instead, the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the lowest-lying excited states are explored with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations and the radiative and nonradiative decay rates from the involved excited states are computed from first-principles using a thermal vibration correlation function formalism. With such a strategy, this work reveals the real origins of the fluorescence quenching, herein entitled as dark-state quenching. Dark states (those that do not absorb or emit light) are often elusive to experiments and thus, computational investigations can provide novel insights into the actual photodeactivation mechanisms. The success of the dark-state quenching mechanism is demonstrated for a wide variety of fluorescent probes, including proton, cation and anion targets. Furthermore, this mechanism provides a general picture of the fluorescence quenching which englobes intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT), ratiometric quenching, and those radiationless mechanisms believed to be originated by PET. Finally, this Account provides for the first time a computational protocol to quantitatively estimate this phenomenon and provides the ingredients for the optimal design of fluorescent probes from first principles.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here, a plant-inspired adhesive hydrogel has been developed based on Ag-Lignin nanoparticles (NPs)triggered dynamic redox catechol chemistry. Ag-Lignin NPs construct the dynamic catechol redox system, which creates long-lasting reductive-oxidative environment inner hydrogel networks. This redox system, generating catechol groups continuously, endows the hydrogel with long-term and repeatable adhesiveness. Furthermore, Ag-Lignin NPs generate free radicals and trigger self-gelation of the hydrogel under ambient environment. This hydrogel presents high toughness for the existence of covalent and non-covalent interaction in the hydrogel networks. The hydrogel also possesses good cell affinity and high antibacterial activity due to the catechol groups and bactericidal ability of Ag-Lignin NPs. This study proposes a strategy to design tough and adhesive hydrogels based on dynamic plant catechol chemistry.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Responsive micro- and nanogels are particularly interesting because the small length scale enables very fast response times. Chemical cross-links provide topological constraints and define the three-dimensional structure of the microgels, whereas their porous structure permits fast mass transfer, enabling very rapid structural adaption of the microgel to the environment. The change of microgel structure involves a unique transition from a flexible, swollen finite-size macromolecular network, characterized by a fuzzy surface, to a colloidal particle with homogeneous density and a sharp surface. In this contribution, we determine, for the first time, the structural evolution during the microgel-to-particle transition. Time-resolved small-angle x-ray scattering experiments and computer simulations unambiguously reveal a two-stage process: In a first, very fast process, collapsed clusters form at the periphery, leading to an intermediate, hollowish core-shell structure that slowly transforms to a globule. This structural evolution is independent of the type of stimulus and thus applies to instantaneous transitions as in a temperature jump or to slower stimuli that rely on the uptake of active molecules from and/or exchange with the environment. The fast transitions of size and shape provide unique opportunities for various applications as, for example, in uptake and release, catalysis, or sensing.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Hydrogel-based actuators that can imitate the capabilities of leptocephali will enable new applications in diverse fields. However, existing hydrogel actuators, mostly osmotic-driven, are intrinsically low-speed and/or low-force; and their camouflage capabilities have not been explored. Here we show that hydraulic actuations of hydrogels with designed structures and properties can give soft actuators and robots that are high-speed, high-force, and optically and sonically camouflaged in water. The hydrogel actuators and robots can maintain their robustness and functionality over multiple cycles of actuations, owing to the anti-fatigue property of the hydrogel under moderate stresses. We further demonstrate that the agile and transparent hydrogel actuators and robots perform extraordinary functions including swimming, kicking rubber-balls and even catching a live fish in water.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The transition metal-based photocatalysts commonly employed in photoredox catalysis absorb efficiently in the visible spectrum, unlike most organic substrates, allowing for orthogonal excitation. The subsequent excited states are both more reducing and more oxidizing than the ground state catalyst and are competitive with some of the more powerful single-electron oxidants or reductants available to organic chemists yet are simply accessed via irradiation. The benefits of this strategy have proven particularly useful in radical chemistry, a field that traditionally employs rather toxic and hazardous reagents to generate the desired intermediates.In this Account, we discuss our efforts to leverage visible light photoredox catalysis in radical-based bond-forming and bond-cleaving events for which few, if any, environmentally benign alternatives exist. Mechanistic investigations have driven our contributions in this field, for both facilitating desired transformations and offering new, unexpected opportunities. In fact, our total synthesis of (+)-gliocladin C was only possible upon elucidating the propensity for various trialkylamine additives to elicit a dual behavior as both a reductive quencher and a H-atom donor. Importantly, while natural product synthesis was central to our initial motivations to explore these photochemical processes, we have since demonstrated applicability within other subfields of chemistry, and our evaluation of flow technologies demonstrates the potential to translate these results from the bench to pilot scale.Our forays into photoredox catalysis began with fundamental methodology, providing a tin-free reductive dehalogenation that exchanged the gamut of hazardous reagents previously employed for such a transformation for visible light-mediated, ambient temperature conditions. Evolving from this work, a new avenue toward atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) chemistry was developed, enabling dual functionalization of both double and triple bonds. Importantly, we have also expanded our portfolio to target clinically relevant scaffolds. Photoredox catalysis proved effective in generating high value fluorinated alkyl radicals through the use of abundantly available starting materials, providing access to libraries of trifluoromethylated (hetero)arenes as well as intriguing gem-difluoro benzyl motifs via a novel photochemical radical Smiles rearrangement. Finally, we discuss a photochemical strategy toward sustainable lignin processing through selective C–O bond cleavage methodology.

However, the utility of existing GEVIs has been limited by the brightness and photostability of fluorescent proteins and rhodopsins. We engineered a GEVI, called Voltron, that uses bright and photostable synthetic dyes instead of protein-based fluorophores, thereby extending the number of neurons imaged simultaneously in vivo by a factor of 10 and enabling imaging for significantly longer durations relative to existing GEVIs. We used Voltron for in vivo voltage imaging in mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies. In the mouse cortex, Voltron allowed single-trial recording of spikes and subthreshold voltage signals from dozens of neurons simultaneously over a 15-minute period of continuous imaging. In larval zebrafish, Voltron enabled the precise correlation of spike timing with behavior.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Many hydrogen-evolving photocatalysts are active in the ultraviolet range, but ultraviolet light accounts for only 3% of the energy available in the solar spectrum at ground level. Solid-state crystalline photocatalysts have light absorption profiles that are a discrete function of their crystalline phase and that are not always tunable. Here, we prepare a series of amorphous, microporous organic polymers with exquisite synthetic control over the optical gap in the range 1.94-2.95 eV. Specific monomer compositions give polymers that are robust and effective photocatalysts for the evolution of hydrogen from water in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor, without the apparent need for an added metal cocatalyst. Remarkably, unlike other organic systems, the best performing polymer is only photoactive under visible rather than ultraviolet irradiation.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

We propose a model in which low-complexity (LC) domains of FUS drive its physiologically reversible assembly into membrane-free, liquid droplet and hydrogel-like structures. ALS/FTD mutations in LC or non-LC domains induce further phase transition into poorly soluble fibrillar hydrogels distinct from conventional amyloids. These assemblies are necessary and sufficient for neurotoxicity in a C. elegans model of FUS-dependent neurodegeneration. They trap other ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granule components and disrupt RNP granule function. One consequence is impairment of new protein synthesis by cytoplasmic RNP granules in axon terminals, where RNP granules regulate local RNA metabolism and translation. Nuclear FUS granules may be similarly affected. Inhibiting formation of these fibrillar hydrogel assemblies mitigates neurotoxicity and suggests a potential therapeutic strategy that may also be applicable to ALS/FTD associated with mutations in other RNA binding proteins.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The typical strategy to functionalize hydrogels with biomolecules involves directly tethering them to the hydrogel backbone resulting in a static material. Thus, this approach fails to capture the dynamic changes in biomolecule composition that occur during biological processes or that may be required for regenerative medicine applications. Moreover, it also limits the scope of biomolecules to simple peptides, as signaling proteins generally have poor stability under cell culture conditions and lose their bioactivity over time. To that end, we sought to develop a bioconjugation reaction that would enable reversible and repeatable tethering of signaling proteins to hydrogels, so that spent protein could be released on-demand and replaced with fresh protein as needed. Specifically, we designed an allyl sulfide chain-transfer agent that enables a reversible, photomediated, thiol–ene bioconjugation of signaling proteins to hydrogels. Upon addition of a thiolated protein to the allyl sulfide moiety, the previously tethered protein is released, and the \"ene\" functionality is regenerated. Using this approach, we demonstrate that protein patterning can be achieved in hydrogels through a thiol–ene reaction, and the patterned protein can then be released through a subsequent thiol–ene reaction of a PEG thiol. Importantly, this process is repeatable through multiple iterations and proceeds at physiologically relevant signaling protein concentrations. Finally, we demonstrate that whole signaling proteins can be patterned and released in the presence of cells, and that cells respond to their presentation with spatial fidelity. Combined, these data represent the first example of a methodology that enables fully reversible and repeatable patterning and release of signaling proteins from hydrogels.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

A porphyrin-catalysed photoinduced electron/energy transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerisation was adapted to enable high throughput synthesis of complex polymer architectures in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on low-volume well plates in the presence of air. The polymerisation system shows remarkable oxygen tolerance, and excellent control of functional 3- and 4-arm star polymers. We then apply this method to investigate the effect of polymer structure on protein binding, in this case to the lectin concanavalin A (ConA). Such an approach could be applied to screen the structure-activity relationships for any number of polymer-protein interactions.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

While various strategies have been developed for antifouling (including superoleophobic) coatings, none of these exhibits self-healing properties because the bestowal of a zoetic self-repairing function to lifeless artificial water/solid interfacial materials is usually confronted with tremendous challenges. Here, we present a self-repairing underwater superoleophobic and antibiofouling coating through the self-assembly of hydrophilic polymeric chain modified hierarchical microgel spheres. The obtained surface material not only has excellent underwater superoleophobicity but also has very good subaqueous antibiofouling properties. More importantly, this surface material can recover the oil- and biofouling-resistant properties once its surface is mechanically damaged, similar to the skins of some marine organisms such as sharks or whales. This approach is feasible and easily mass-produced and could open a pathway and possibility for the fabrication of other self-healing functional water/solid interfacial materials.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we demonstrate a low-cost polymer donor poly[(thiophene)-alt-(6,7-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyloxy)quinoxaline)] (PTQ10), which is synthesized with high overall yield of 87.4% via only two-step reactions from cheap raw materials. More importantly, an impressive efficiency of 12.70% is obtained for the devices with PTQ10 as donor, and the efficiency of the inverted structured PTQ10-based device also reaches 12.13% (certificated to be 12.0%). Furthermore, the as-cast devices also demonstrate a high efficiency of 10.41% and the devices exhibit insensitivity of active layer thickness from 100 nm to 300 nm, which is conductive to the large area fabrication of the devices. In considering the advantages of low cost and high efficiency with thickness insensitivity, we believe that PTQ10 will be a promising polymer donor for commercial application of polymer solar cells.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

How Halide Ion Defects Influence Photoinduced Segregation in Mixed Halide Perovskites\nYear: 2017  Citations: 331\nAbstract:\nMinimizing photoinduced segregation in mixed halide lead perovskites is important for achieving stable photovoltaic performance. The shift in the absorption and the rate of formation of iodide- and bromide-rich regions following visible excitation of mixed halide lead perovskites is found to strongly depend on the halide ion concentration. Slower formation and recovery rates observed in halide-deficient films indicate the involvement of defect sites in influencing halide phase segregation. At higher halide concentrations (in stoichiometric excess), segregation effects become less prominent, as evidenced by faster recovery kinetics. These results suggest that light-induced compositional segregation can be minimized in mixed halide perovskite films by using excess halide ions. The findings from this study further reflect the importance of halide ion post-treatment of perovskite films to improve their solar cell performance.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The development of multifunctional bioactive biomaterials with integrated bone and soft tissue regeneration is necessary and needed urgently in orthopedics. In this work, we found that the photoactivated MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheet showed positive effects on promoting both bone and soft tissue regeneration. We further investigated the detailed effect and potential mechanism of photoactivated MXene on tissue regeneration. Photoactivated MXene shows a good thermal effect and robust antibacterial activity to inhibit the expression of inflammation factors and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and induces the expression of pro-angiogenic factors and soft tissue wound repair. Photoactivated MXene can also regulate the osteogenic differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) through the ERK signaling pathway by activating the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and enhancing the repair of bone tissue.

In this paper, we propose a person recognition method using the information extracted from body images. Our research is novel in the following three ways compared to previous studies. First, we use the images of human body for recognizing individuals. To overcome the limitations of previous studies on body-based person recognition that use only visible light images for recognition, we use human body images captured by two different kinds of camera, including a visible light camera and a thermal camera. The use of two different kinds of body image helps us to reduce the effects of noise, background, and variation in the appearance of a human body. Second, we apply a state-of-the art method, called convolutional neural network (CNN) among various available methods, for image features extraction in order to overcome the limitations of traditional hand-designed image feature extraction methods.

However, these kinds of materials are really scarce now, especially for those with efficient RTP emissions, which have largely limited their practical applications. Here, an all‐around‐type player in the field of photoinduced phosphorescence material appears, whose RTP efficiency can increase from near 0 to 22% after continuous UV irradiation. Correspondingly, the UV‐written patterns based on them can be clearly observed by the naked eye in daytime or even under sunlight. Moreover, these materials are found to show excellent photostability, and the strong RTP emission can still be observed after repeated activation for more than 50 times. The high RTP efficiency and good photostability make these photoinduced RTP materials exhibit an attractive prospect for potential applications in many fields, including leak test, microcrack detection, programmable information storage, and encryption.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

To overcome this limitation, we report on a novel mitochondria-localized iridium(III) endoperoxide prodrug (2-O-IrAn), which, upon two-photon irradiation in NIR, synergistically releases a highly cytotoxic iridium(III) complex (2-IrAn), singlet oxygen, and an alkoxy radical. 2-O-IrAn was found to be highly (photo-)toxic in hypoxic tumor cells and multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) in the nanomolar range. To provide cancer selectivity and improve the pharmacological properties of 2-O-IrAn, it was encapsulated into a biotin-functionalized polymer. The generated nanoparticles were found to nearly fully eradicate the tumor inside a mouse model within a single treatment. This study presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of an iridium(III)-based endoperoxide prodrug for synergistic photodynamic therapy/photoactivated chemotherapy, opening up new avenues for the treatment of hypoxic tumors.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we reinforce soft hydrogels with highly organized, high-porosity microfibre networks that are 3D-printed with a technique termed as melt electrospinning writing. We show that the stiffness of the gel/scaffold composites increases synergistically (up to 54-fold), compared with hydrogels or microfibre scaffolds alone. Modelling affirms that reinforcement with defined microscale structures is applicable to numerous hydrogels. The stiffness and elasticity of the composites approach that of articular cartilage tissue. Human chondrocytes embedded in the composites are viable, retain their round morphology and are responsive to an in vitro physiological loading regime in terms of gene expression and matrix production. The current approach of reinforcing hydrogels with 3D-printed microfibres offers a fundament for producing tissue constructs with biological and mechanical compatibility. Hydrogels are commonly used materials for tissue engineering, but they can lack the structural properties required for load-bearing and mechanical applications.

These results are correlated with spectroelectrochemical measurements of Co II oxidation to Co III in a CoPi/FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) electrode during dark electrocatalytic water oxidation. Electrocatalytic water oxidation exhibits a non‐linear dependence on Co III density, with a sharp onset at 1 × 10 17 Co III cm −2 . These results are compared quantitatively with the degree of CoPi oxidation observed under conditions of photoinduced water oxidation on CoPi–BiVO 4 photoanodes. For the CoPi–BiVO 4 photoanodes studied herein, ≤5% of water oxidation proceeds from CoPi sites, making the BiVO 4 surface the predominant water oxidation site. This study highlights two key factors that limit the ability of CoPi to improve the catalytic performance of BiVO 4 : 1) the kinetics of hole transfer from the BiVO 4 to the CoPi layer are too slow to effectively compete with direct water oxidation from BiVO 4 ; 2) the slow water oxidation kinetics of CoPi result in a large accumulation of Co III states, causing an increase in recombination. Addressing these factors will be essential for improving the performance of CoPi on photoanodes for solar‐driven water oxidation.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Cell-laden hydrogel (\"bioink\") bioprinting is especially advantageous for tissue engineering applications as multiple cells and biomaterial compositions can be selectively dispensed to create spatially well-defined architectures. Despite this promise, few hydrogel systems are easily available and suitable as bioinks, with even fewer systems allowing for molecular design of mechanical and biological properties. In this study, we report the development of a norbornene functionalized alginate system as a cell-laden bioink for extrusion-based bioprinting, with a rapid UV-induced thiol-ene cross-linking mechanism that avoids acrylate kinetic chain formation. The mechanical and swelling properties of the hydrogels are tunable by varying the concentration, length, and structure of dithiol PEG cross-linkers and can be further modified by postprinting secondary cross-linking with divalent ions such as calcium. The low concentrations of alginate needed (<2 wt %), coupled with their rapid in situ gelation, allow both the maintenance of high cell viability and the ability to fabricate large multilayer or multibioink constructs with identical bioprinting conditions. The modularity of this bioink platform design enables not only the rational design of materials properties but also the gel's biofunctionality (as shown via RGD attachment) for the expected tissue-engineering application. This modularity enables the creation of multizonal and multicellular constructs utilizing a chemically similar bioink platform. Such tailorable bioink platforms will enable increased complexity in 3D bioprinted constructs.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Herein, we developed a trialkylsilyl substituted 2D-conjugated polymer with the highest occupied molecular orbital level down-shifted by Si–C bond interaction. The polymer solar cells obtained by pairing this polymer with a non-fullerene acceptor demonstrated a high power conversion efficiency of 11.41% with both high open circuit voltage of 0.94 V and high short circuit current density of 17.32 mA cm −2 benefitted from the complementary absorption of the donor and acceptor, and the high hole transfer efficiency from acceptor to donor although the highest occupied molecular orbital level difference between the donor and acceptor is only 0.11 eV. The results indicate that the alkylsilyl substitution is an effective way in designing high performance conjugated polymer photovoltaic materials.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

It is important to precisely control hydrogels deposition during printing the mimic organ structures. However, the printability of hydrogels about printing parameters is seldom addressed. In this paper, we systemically investigated the printability of hydrogels from printing lines (one dimensional, 1D structures) to printing lattices/films (two dimensional, 2D structures) and printing 3D structures with a special attention to the accurate printing. After a series of experiments, we discovered the relationships between the important factors such as air pressure, feedrate, or even printing distance and the printing quality of the expected structures. Dumbbell shape was observed in the lattice structures printing due to the hydrogel diffuses at the intersection. Collapses and fusion of adjacent layer would result in the error accumulation at Z direction which was an important fact that could cause printing failure. Finally, we successfully demonstrated a 3D printing hydrogel scaffold through harmonize with all the parameters. The cell viability after printing was compared with the casting and the results showed that our bioprinting method almost had no extra damage to the cells.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Of the 259 total bottles processed, 93% showed some sign of microplastic contamination. After accounting for possible background (lab) contamination, an average of 10.4 microplastic particles >100 um in size per liter of bottled water processed were found. Fragments were the most common morphology (66%) followed by fibers. Half of these particles were confirmed to be polymeric in nature using FTIR spectroscopy with polypropylene being the most common polymer type (54%), which matches a common plastic used for the manufacture of bottle caps. A small fraction of particles (4%) showed the presence of industrial lubricants. While spectroscopic analysis of particles smaller than 100 um was not possible, the adsorption of the Nile Red dye indicates that these particles are most probably plastic. Including these smaller particles (6.5–100 um), an average of 325 microplastic particles per liter of bottled water was found. Microplastic contamination range of 0 to over 10,000 microplastic particles per liter with 95% of particles being between 6.5–100 um in size. Data suggests the contamination is at least partially coming from the packaging and/or the bottling process itself. Given the prevalence of the consumption of bottled water across the globe, the results of this study support the need for further studies on the impacts of micro- and nano- plastics on human health.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

A simple and general method to tow microscopic particles in water by using remotely controllable light‐activated hematite microdockers is demonstrated. These anisotropic ferromagnetic particles can be synthesized in bulk and present the remarkable ability to be activated by light while independently manipulated via external fields. The photoactivation process induces a phoretic flow capable to attract cargos toward the surface of the propellers, while a rotating magnetic field is used to transport the composite particles to any location of the experimental platform. The method allows the assembling of small colloidal clusters of various sizes, composed by a skeleton of mobile magnetic dockers, which cooperatively keep, transport, and release the microscopic cargos. The possibility to easily reconfigure in situ the location of the docker above the cargo is demonstrated, which enables optimize transport and cargo release operations.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The key to realize this reaction is to find an efficient and robust photocatalyst that ideally makes use of the energy from sunlight. Recently, due to the attractive properties such as appropriate band structure, ultrahigh specific surface area, and more exposed active sites, two-dimensional (2D) photocatalysts have attracted significant attention for photocatalytic water splitting. This Review attempts to summarize recent progress in the fabrication and applications of 2D photocatalysts including graphene-based photocatalysts, 2D oxides, 2D chalcogenides, 2D carbon nitride, and some other emerging 2D materials for water splitting. The construction strategies and characterization techniques for 2D/2D photocatalysts are summarized. Particular attention has been paid to the role of 2D/2D interfaces in these 2D photocatalysts as the interfaces and heterojunctions are critical for facilitating charge separation and improving photocatalysis efficiency. We also critically discuss their stability as photocatalysts for water splitting. Finally, we highlight the ongoing challenges and opportunities for the future development of 2D photocatalysts in this exciting and still emerging area of research.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The as-synthesized ZnIn 2 S 4 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction nanosheets exhibit remarkably enhancement on the photocatalytic activity for H 2 production. This enhanced photoactivity is mainly attributed to the efficient interfacial transfer of photoinduced electrons and holes from g-C 3 N 4 to ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets, resulting in the decreased charge recombination on g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets and the increased amount of photoinduced charge carriers in ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets. Meanwhile, the increased surface-active-sites and extended light absorption of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets after the decoration of ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheets may also play a certain role for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. Further investigations by the surface photovoltage spectroscopy and transient photoluminescence spectroscopy demonstrate that ZnIn 2 S 4 /g-C 3 N 4 heterojunction nanosheets considerable boost the charge transfer efficiency, therefore improve the probability of photoinduced charge carriers to reach the photocatalysts surfaces for highly efficient H 2 production.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

We introduce a versatile method to detect mRNA at a single living cell level that uses photocleavable hairpin probes as functional units for the optical (fluorescent) and electrochemical (voltammetric) detection of MnSOD mRNA in single MCF-7 cancer cells. The fluorescent probe is composed of an ortho-nitrophenylphosphate ester functionalized hairpin that includes the FAM fluorophore in a caged configuration quenched by Dabcyl. The fluorescent probe is further modified with the AS1411 aptamer to facilitate the targeting and internalization of the probe into the MCF-7 cells. Under UV irradiation, the hairpin is cleaved, leading to the intracellular mRNA toehold-stimulated displacement of the FAM-functionalized strand resulting in a switched-on fluorescence signal upon the detection of the mRNA in a single cell. In addition, a nanoelectrode functionalized with a methylene blue (MB) redox-active photocleavable hairpin is inserted into the cytoplasm of a single MCF-7 cell. Photocleavage of the hairpin leads to the mRNA-mediated toehold displacement of the redox-active strand associated with the probe, leading to the depletion of the voltammetric response of the probe. The parallel optical and electrochemical detection of the mRNA at a single cell level is demonstrated.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Variable iridescence has attracted particular interest because of the displays of various brilliant examples. Existing synthetic, variable, structural color materials require external stimuli to provide changing displays, despite autonomous regulation being widespread among natural organisms, and therefore suffer from inherent limitations. Inspired by the structural color regulation mechanism of chameleons, we present a conceptually different structural color material that has autonomic regulation capability by assembling engineered cardiomyocyte tissues on synthetic inverse opal hydrogel films. The cell elongation and contraction in the beating processes of the cardiomyocytes caused the inverse opal structure of the substrate film to follow the same cycle of volume or morphology changes. This was observed as the synchronous shifting of its photonic band gap and structural colors. Such biohybrid structural color hydrogels can be used to construct a variety of living materials, such as two-dimensional self-regulating structural color patterns and three-dimensional dynamic Morpho butterflies. These examples indicated that the stratagem could provide an intrinsic color-sensing feedback to modify the system behavior/action for future biohybrid robots. In addition, by integrating the biohybrid structural color hydrogels into microfluidics, we developed a \"heart-on-a-chip\" platform featuring microphysiological visuality for biological research and drug screening. This biohybrid, living, structural color hydrogel may be widely used in the design of a variety of intelligent actuators and soft robotic devices.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

We unravel new levels of structural details and address the challenge of reconstructing 3D information from 2D projections for nonuniform soft matter as opposed to monodisperse proteins.

Here, we study the impact of post-deposition surface modifications on photoinduced halide segregation in methylammonium lead mixed-halide perovskites. By coating a perovskite surface with the electron-donating ligand trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), we are able to both reduce nonradiative recombination and dramatically slow the onset of halide segregation in CH3NH3PbI2Br films. This result, coupled with the observation that the rate of halide segregation can be tuned by varying the selective contact, provides a direct link between surface modifications and photoinduced trap formation. On the basis of these observations, we discuss possible mechanisms for photoinduced halide segregation supported by drift-diffusion simulations. This work suggests that improved understanding and control of perovskite surfaces provides a pathway toward stable and high-performance wide-bandgap perovskites for the next generation of tandem solar cells.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

As signaling often relies on transiently formed microdomains of elevated second messenger concentration, means to precisely perturb the spatiotemporal dynamics of cNMPs are uniquely poised for the interrogation of the underlying physiological processes. Optogenetics appears particularly suited as it affords light-dependent, accurate control in time and space of diverse cellular processes. Several sensory photoreceptors function as photoactivated adenylyl cyclases (PAC) and hence serve as light-regulated actuators for the control of intracellular levels of 3′, 5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate. To characterize PACs and to refine their properties, we devised a test bed for the facile analysis of these photoreceptors. Cyclase activity is monitored in bacterial cells via expression of a fluorescent reporter, and programmable illumination allows the rapid exploration of multiple lighting regimes. We thus probed two PACs responding to blue and red light, respectively, and observed significant dark activity for both. We next engineered derivatives of the red-light-sensitive PAC with altered responses to light, with one variant, denoted Dd PAC, showing enhanced response to light. These PAC variants stand to enrich the optogenetic toolkit and thus facilitate the detailed analysis of cNMP metabolism and signaling.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) present an interesting new class of photoactive materials, which combine three key features relevant to the photocatalytic process, namely crystallinity, porosity and tunability. Here we synthesize a series of water- and photostable 2D azine-linked COFs from hydrazine and triphenylarene aldehydes with varying number of nitrogen atoms. The electronic and steric variations in the precursors are transferred to the resulting frameworks, thus leading to a progressively enhanced light-induced hydrogen evolution with increasing nitrogen content in the frameworks. Our results demonstrate that by the rational design of COFs on a molecular level, it is possible to precisely adjust their structural and optoelectronic properties, thus resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activities. This is expected to spur further interest in these photofunctional frameworks where rational supramolecular engineering may lead to new material applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, the biocompatibility and biodegradability of inorganic or synthetic stabilizers limit their applications. Herein, we describe high‐internal‐phase Pickering emulsions with 87 % edible oil or 88 % n ‐hexane in water stabilized by peanut‐protein‐isolate microgel particles. These dispersed phase fractions are the highest in all known food‐grade Pickering emulsions. The protein‐based microgel particles are in different aggregate states depending on the pH value. The emulsions can be utilized for multiple potential applications simply by changing the internal‐phase composition. A substitute for partially hydrogenated vegetable oils is obtained when the internal phase is an edible oil. If the internal phase is n ‐hexane, the emulsion can be used as a template to produce porous materials, which are advantageous for tissue engineering.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, existing hydrogel–elastomer hybrids have limitations such as weak interfacial bonding, low robustness and difficulties in patterning microstructures. Here, we report a simple yet versatile method to assemble hydrogels and elastomers into hybrids with extremely robust interfaces (interfacial toughness over 1,000 Jm −2 ) and functional microstructures such as microfluidic channels and electrical circuits. The proposed method is generally applicable to various types of tough hydrogels and diverse commonly used elastomers including polydimethylsiloxane Sylgard 184, polyurethane, latex, VHB and Ecoflex. We further demonstrate applications enabled by the robust and microstructured hydrogel–elastomer hybrids including anti-dehydration hydrogel–elastomer hybrids, stretchable and reactive hydrogel–elastomer microfluidics, and stretchable hydrogel circuit boards patterned on elastomer.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

As a consequence, these smart microgel particles are being considered for applications ranging from viscosity modifiers and sensing to drug delivery and as models for the glass and the jamming transition. Despite their widespread use, little is known about how these soft particles adapt their shape and size under strong mechanical compression. We use a combination of precise labeling protocols and two-color superresolution microscopy to unravel the behavior of tracer microgels inside densely packed soft solids. We find that interpenetration and shape deformation are dominant until, in the highly overpacked state, this mechanism saturates and the only remaining way to further densify the system is by isotropic compression.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Existing hemostatic agents poorly control hemorrhaging from traumatic arterial and cardiac wounds because of their weak adhesion to wet and mobile tissues. Here we design a photo-reactive adhesive that mimics the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. This biomacromolecule-based matrix hydrogel can undergo rapid gelling and fixation to adhere and seal bleeding arteries and cardiac walls after UV light irradiation. These repairs can withstand up to 290 mm Hg blood pressure, significantly higher than blood pressures in most clinical settings (systolic BP 60-160 mm Hg). Most importantly, the hydrogel can stop high-pressure bleeding from pig carotid arteries with 4~ 5 mm-long incision wounds and from pig hearts with 6 mm diameter cardiac penetration holes. Treated pigs survived after hemostatic treatments with this hydrogel, which is well-tolerated and appears to offer significant clinical advantage as a traumatic wound sealant.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Their shape results from two modes of cell wall insertion, one allowing division and one allowing elongation. Both cell wall synthesis modes rely on a single cytoskeletal protein, FtsZ. Despite the central role of FtsZ in ovococci, a detailed view of the in vivo nanostructure of ovococcal Z-rings has been lacking thus far, limiting our understanding of their assembly and architecture. We have developed the use of photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) in the ovococcus human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae by engineering spDendra2, a photoconvertible fluorescent protein optimized for this bacterium. Labeling of endogenously expressed FtsZ with spDendra2 revealed the remodeling of the Z-ring's morphology during the division cycle at the nanoscale level. We show that changes in the ring's axial thickness and in the clustering propensity of FtsZ correlate with the advancement of the cell cycle. In addition, we observe double-ring substructures suggestive of short-lived intermediates that may form upon initiation of septal cell wall synthesis. These data are integrated into a model describing the architecture and the remodeling of the Z-ring during the cell cycle of ovococci.The Gram-positive human pathogen S. pneumoniae is responsible for 1.6 million deaths per year worldwide and is increasingly resistant to various antibiotics. FtsZ is a cytoskeletal protein polymerizing at midcell into a ring-like structure called the Z-ring. FtsZ is a promising new antimicrobial target, as its inhibition leads to cell death. A precise view of the Z-ring architecture in vivo is essential to understand the mode of action of inhibitory drugs (see T. den Blaauwen, J. M. Andreu, and O. Monasterio, Bioorg Chem 55:27-38, 2014, doi:10.1016/j.bioorg.2014.03.007, for a review on FtsZ inhibitors). This is notably true in ovococcoid bacteria like S. pneumoniae, in which FtsZ is the only known cytoskeletal protein. We have used superresolution microscopy to obtain molecular details of the pneumococcus Z-ring that have so far been inaccessible with conventional microscopy. This study provides a nanoscale description of the Z-ring architecture and remodeling during the division of ovococci.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Upon increasing the polymer concentration, we cross successively the well defined glass and jamming transitions which delimit four different states: dilute colloidal suspension, entropic glass, jammed glass, and dense glass. Each state has a specific dynamical fingerprint dictated by two key ingredients related to particle softness: elastic contact interactions, and osmotic or steric deswelling. Soft interactions control yielding and flow of the jammed glasses. The shrinkage of the microgels makes the glass transition look smoother than in hard sphere suspensions. We quantify the relationship between the polymer concentration and the volume fraction, and show that the glass transition behaviour of soft microgels can be mapped to that of hard sphere glasses once the volume fraction is used as the control parameter.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Routes toward intrinsically stretchable molecular materials remain scarce but, if successful, will enable simpler fabrication processes, such as direct printing and coating, mechanically robust devices, and more intimate contact with objects. We report a highly stretchable conducting polymer, realized with a range of enhancers that serve a dual function: (i) they change morphology and (ii) they act as conductivity-enhancing dopants in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The polymer films exhibit conductivities comparable to the best reported values for PEDOT:PSS, with over 3100 S/cm under 0% strain and over 4100 S/cm under 100% strain-among the highest for reported stretchable conductors. It is highly durable under cyclic loading, with the conductivity maintained at 3600 S/cm even after 1000 cycles to 100% strain. The conductivity remained above 100 S/cm under 600% strain, with a fracture strain of 800%, which is superior to even the best silver nanowire- or carbon nanotube-based stretchable conductor films. The combination of excellent electrical and mechanical properties allowed it to serve as interconnects for field-effect transistor arrays with a device density that is five times higher than typical lithographically patterned wavy interconnects.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In the present paper, we study the two-dimensional organization of charged and quasi-neutral microgels with different cross-linking densities, under compression at the air-water interface and the transfer of the microgel monolayer onto a solid substrate at different surface pressures. At low cross-linking densities, the microgels form highly ordered hexagonal lattices on the solid substrate over large areas, with a unique lattice parameter that decreases continuously as the surface pressure increases. We thus prove that the microgel conformation evolves at the air-water interface. The microgels undergo a continuous transition from a highly flattened state at low surface coverage, where the maximal polymer segments are adsorbed at the interface, to entangled flattened microgels, and finally the thickening of the layer up to a dense hydrogel layer of compacted microgels. Moreover, two batches of microgels, with and without charges, are compared. The contribution of electrostatic interactions is assessed via changing the charge density of the microgels or modulating the Debye length. In both cases, electrostatics does not change the lattice parameter, meaning that, despite the microgel different swelling ratio, charges do not affect neither interactions between particles at the interface nor microgels adsorption. Conversely, the cross-linking density has a strong impact on microgel packing at the interface: increasing the cross-linking density strongly decreases the extent of microgel flattening and promotes the occurrence of coexisting hexagonally ordered domains with different lattice parameters.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

N2 reduction to NH3 is essential to the chemical industry and to the Earth's nitrogen cycle. Industrially, NH3 is synthesized by the Haber-Bosch process under extreme conditions (400-500 °C, 200-250 bar), stimulating research into the development of sustainable technologies for NH3 production. Herein, this study demonstrates that ultrathin layered-double-hydroxide (LDH) photocatalysts, in particular CuCr-LDH nanosheets, possess remarkable photocatalytic activity for the photoreduction of N2 to NH3 in water at 25 °C under visible-light irradiation. The excellent activity can be attributed to the severely distorted structure and compressive strain in the LDH nanosheets, which significantly enhances N2 chemisorption and thereby promotes NH3 formation.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Inspired by a metalloenzyme in a variety of microorganisms, here, we propose a photoactivated H2 nanogenerator that comprises a fluorinated chitosan (FCS), a chemotherapeutic drug (gemcitabine, GEM), and a catalyst of H2 production ([FeFe]TPP) that can form self-assembled [FeFe]TPP/GEM/FCS nanoparticles (NPs). The [FeFe]TPP/GEM/FCS NPs exhibit excellent transmucosal and tumor cell penetration capacities after intravesical instillation into the bladder and can efficiently produce H2 gas in situ upon 660 nm laser irradiation, which significantly enhances the efficacy of hydrogen chemotherapy of cancer in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we discover that H2 gas in hydrogen chemotherapy can inhibit mitochondrial function, hinder ATP synthesis, and cause a reduction of the P-gp efflux pump function, which finally attenuates P-gp protein drug transport capacity in cancer cells. This photoactivated H2 evolution in situ to improve the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy of bladder cancer may present an effective hydrogen chemotherapy strategy for cancer treatment.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, a direct three-dimensional visualization of individual particles in-situ has so far been hindered by insufficient resolution, with optical microscopy, or contrast, with electron microscopy. In recent years superresolution microscopy techniques have emerged that can provide nanoscopic optical resolution. Here we report on the in-situ superresolution microscopy of dye-labelled submicron sized pNIPAM microgels revealing the internal density profile during swelling and collapse of individual particles. Using direct STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM) we demonstrate a lateral optical resolution of 30 nm and an axial resolution of 60 nm.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, UV-based direct ink writing (DIW) is facing a trade-off between required curing intensity and effectiveness range, and it cannot implement multiscale parallelization at ease. We overcome these difficulties by ink design and introducing near-infrared (NIR) laser assisted module, and this increases the scalability of direct ink writing to solidify the deposited filament with diameter up to 4 mm, which is much beyond any of existing UV-assisted DIW. The NIR effectiveness range can expand to tens of centimeters and deliver the embedded writing capability. We also demonstrate its parallel manufacturing capability for simultaneous curing of multi-color filaments and freestanding objects. The strategy owns further advantages to be integrated with other types of ink-based 3D printing technologies for extensive applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Doping can narrow the band gap of titanium dioxide; however, new charge-carrier recombination centres may be introduced. Here we report the design of sub-10 nm rutile titanium dioxide nanoparticles, with an increased amount of surface/sub-surface defects to overcome the negative effects from bulk defects. Abundant defects can not only shift the top of the valence band of rutile titanium dioxide upwards for band-gap narrowing but also promote charge-carrier separation. The role of titanium(III) is to enhance, rather than initiate, the visible-light-driven water splitting. The sub-10 nm rutile nanoparticles exhibit the state-of-the-art activity among titanium dioxide-based semiconductors for visible-light-driven water splitting and the concept of ultra-small nanoparticles with abundant defects may be extended to the design of other robust semiconductor photocatalysts. Titanium dioxide is a promising photocatalyst for water splitting, although it suffers from low visible light activity. Here, the authors fabricate sub-10 nm rutile nanoparticles and investigate the role of surface/sub-surface defects in band-gap narrowing and enhanced charge-carrier separation.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

While pairs of cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (FPs) are most commonly used as FRET partner fluorophores, respectively, green and red FPs offer distinct advantages for FRET, such as greater spectral separation, less phototoxicity, and lower autofluorescence. We previously developed the green-red FRET pair Clover and mRuby2, which improves responsiveness in intramolecular FRET reporters with different designs. Here we report the engineering of brighter and more photostable variants, mClover3 and mRuby3. mClover3 improves photostability by 60% and mRuby3 by 200% over the previous generation of fluorophores. Notably, mRuby3 is also 35% brighter than mRuby2, making it both the brightest and most photostable monomeric red FP yet characterized. Furthermore, we developed a standardized methodology for assessing FP performance in mammalian cells as stand-alone markers and as FRET partners. We found that mClover3 or mRuby3 expression in mammalian cells provides the highest fluorescence signals of all jellyfish GFP or coral RFP derivatives, respectively. Finally, using mClover3 and mRuby3, we engineered an improved version of the CaMKIIα reporter Camuiα with a larger response amplitude.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

By contrast to the isotropic osmotic deswelling of soft particles, the particle-particle contacts give rise to a non-homogeneous pressure, raising the question if these deformations occur through homogeneous deswelling or by the formation of facets. Here we aim to answer this question through a combination of imaging of individual microgels in dense packings and a simple model to describe the balance between shape versus volume changes. We find a transition from shape changes at low pressures to volume changes at high pressures, which can be explained qualitatively with our model. Whereas contact mechanics govern at low pressures giving rise to facets, osmotic effects govern at higher pressures, which leads to a more homogeneous deswelling. Our results show that both types of deformation play a large role in highly concentrated microgel suspensions and thus must be taken into account to arrive at an accurate description of the structure, dynamics and mechanics of concentrated suspensions of soft spheres.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Precise spatiotemporal control over their cytotoxic activity would allow improving chemotherapy treatments, and light-regulated drugs are well suited to this purpose. We have developed phototrexate, the first photoswitchable inhibitor of the human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), as a photochromic analogue of methotrexate, a widely prescribed chemotherapeutic drug to treat cancer and psoriasis. Quantification of the light-regulated DHFR enzymatic activity, cell proliferation, and in vivo effects in zebrafish show that phototrexate behaves as a potent antifolate in its photoactivated cis configuration and that it is nearly inactive in its dark-relaxed trans form. Thus, phototrexate constitutes a proof-of-concept to design light-regulated cytotoxic small molecules and a step forward to develop targeted anticancer photochemotherapies with localized efficacy and reduced adverse effects.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Herein, infrared-light-responsive photoinduced carriers driver is first constructed taking advantage of pyroelectric effect for enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In order to give full play to its role, the photocatalytic reaction is localized on the surface and interface of the composite based on a new semi-immersion type heat collected photocatalytic microfiber system. The system is consisted of distinctive pyroelectric substrate poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluropropylene (PVDF-HFP), typical photothermal material carbon nanotube (CNT), and representative photocatalyst CdS. The transient photocurrent, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, time-resolved photoluminescence and pyroelectric potential characterizations indicate that the infrared-light-responsive carriers driver significantly promotes the photogenerated charge separation, accelerates carrier migration, and prolongs carrier lifetime. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution efficiency is remarkably improved more than five times with the highest average apparent quantum yield of 16.9%.

However, limited blood circulation time and poor tumor-targeting capability challenge the therapeutic efficacy of UCNP-based PDT in vivo. Here, we demonstrate intravenous injectable stem-cell-membrane-camouflaged upconversion nanoarchitectures as a biomimetic tumor PDT platform. The biomimetic PDT system is constructed by fusing mesoporous-silica-encapsulated β-NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs with stem-cell membranes. Translocation of the stem-cell membranes to the UCNPs led to the translation of multiple membrane components, bringing the membranes' long circulation and tumor-targeting capability to the resulting platform. Multiphotosensitizers were encapsulated and simultaneously activated by a 980 nm single laser because of the multicolor emission capability of the UCNP cores. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that this novel platform inherits the tumor-targeting properties of stem cells and exhibits remarkable accumulation at the tumor site. In vivo tumor PDT results show higher tumor inhibition efficacy by tail intravenous administration of this new photosensitizer-loaded system. This stem-cell-membrane-camouflaged upconversion nanoarchitecture provides artificial UCNPs with natural cell membranes and holds considerable promise for deep-tissue PDT cancer treatment by systemic administration.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Microgels with independently controlled compartments that can encapsulate cells within separately confined hydrogel matrices would provide precise control over the route of pairing single cells. Here, a one-step microfluidic method is presented to generate monodisperse multicompartment microgels that can be used as a 3D matrix to pair single cells in a highly biocompatible manner. A method is presented to induce microgels formation on chip, followed by direct extraction of the microgels from oil phase, thereby avoiding prolonged exposure of the microgels to the oil. It is further demonstrated that by entrapping stem cells with niche cells within separate but adjacent compartments of the microgels, it can create complex stem cell niche microenvironments in a controlled manner, which can serve as a useful tool for the study of cell-cell interactions. This microfluidic technique represents a significant step toward high-throughput single cells encapsulation and pairing for the study of intercellular communications at single cell level, which is of significant importance for cell biology, stem cell therapy, and tissue engineering.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In a comprehensive study, the probe structure was optimized with regard to its inherent reactivity in the nucleophile-triggered rearrangement reaction. Detailed structure-reactivity relationships could be derived, in particular with regard to the type of integrated (het)aryl moieties as well as the location of the formyl residue, and the probes' intrinsic reactivity with primary and secondary amines was optimized. Utilizing an ancillary base, the initially formed rearrangement product can engage in a subsequent catalytic cycle, leading to an amplified decoloration process. This additional catalytic pathway allows us to enhance the sensitivity of our method and successfully discriminate between amines and thiols. Moreover, probes that exhibit strong analyte-induced fluorescence modulation have been designed to further decrease the detection limit by using a more sensitive read-out. The optimized DAE probes are promising molecular components for future programmable sensing materials and devices.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Carbon derivatives showed only marginal enhancement in stem cell differentiation toward bone formation. Here we report that red-light absorbing carbon nitride (C3N4) sheets lead to remarkable proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) activation, a key transcription factor associated with osteoblast differentiation. Accordingly, highly effective hBMSCs-driven mice bone regeneration under red light is achieved (91% recovery after 4 weeks compared to 36% recovery in the standard control group in phosphate-buffered saline without red light). This fast bone regeneration is attributed to the deep penetration strength of red light into cellular membranes via tissue and the resulting efficient cell stimulation by enhanced photocurrent upon two-photon excitation of C3N4 sheets near cells. Given that the photoinduced charge transfer can increase cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation, this increase would promote nucleotide synthesis and cellular proliferation/differentiation. The cell stimulation enhances hBMSC differentiation toward bone formation, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of near-infrared two-photon absorption of C3N4 sheets in bone regeneration and fracture healing.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we employ density functional theory calculations to direct atomic-level exploration, design and fabrication of a MXene material, Ti 3 C 2 nanoparticles, as a highly efficient co-catalyst. Ti 3 C 2 nanoparticles are rationally integrated with cadmium sulfide via a hydrothermal strategy to induce a super high visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of 14,342 μmol h −1 g −1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 40.1% at 420 nm. This high performance arises from the favourable Fermi level position, electrical conductivity and hydrogen evolution capacity of Ti 3 C 2 nanoparticles. Furthermore, Ti 3 C 2 nanoparticles also serve as an efficient co-catalyst on ZnS or Zn x Cd 1− x S. This work demonstrates the potential of earth-abundant MXene family materials to construct numerous high performance and low-cost photocatalysts/photoelectrodes.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

This study reports the synergistic photoactivated antimicrobial interactions of CDots with photosensitizers on bacterial cells.The antimicrobial effects of the CDots with surface passivation molecules 2,2'-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) in combination with photosensitizer methylene blue (MB) or toluidine blue (TB) at various concentrations were evaluated against Escherichia coli cells with and without 1-hour visible light illumination. The broth microdilution checkerboard method and isobologram analysis were used for determining if synergistic effect existed between CDots and MB or TB.The results showed that CDots alone at a concentration of 5 μg/mL did not display antimicrobial effects, 1 μg/mL MB alone only decreased 1.86 log of viable cell numbers, but the combination treatment with 5 μg/mL CDots combined with 1 μg/mL MB completely inhibited bacteria growth, resulted in 6.2 log viable cell number reduction, suggesting synergistic interaction between the two. The antimicrobial effects of CDots/TB combination exhibited similarly synergistic effects on E. coli cells. These synergistic effects between CDots and MB or TB were further confirmed using the checkerboard microdilution methods, where the fractional inhibitory concentration index value (0.5) and the isobologram analyses. The synergistic interactions were also correlated to the increased generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species in E. coli cells upon the combination treatments of CDots/MB or CDots/TB.The study demonstrated the synergistic photoactivated antimicrobial effects of CDots in combination with other photosensitizers. Such synergistic effect may open new strategies for developing highly effective antimicrobial methods.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, the current photocatalysts suffer from inefficient photoabsorption, rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, and inadequate surface reactive sites. Introduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in photocatalysts has been demonstrated to be an efficacious strategy to solve these issues and improve photocatalytic efficiency. This review systematically summarizes the recent progress in the oxygen vacant semiconductor photocatalysts. Firstly, the formation and characterizations of OVs in semiconductor photocatalysts are briefly introduced. Then, highlighted are the roles of OVs in the photocatalytic reactions of three types of typical oxygen‐containing semiconductors, including metal oxides (TiO 2 , ZnO, WO 3 , W 18 O 49 , MoO 3 , BiO 2‐x , SnO 2 , etc), hydroxides (In(OH) 3 , Ln(OH) 3 (Ln=La, Pr, and Nd), Layered double hydroxides) and oxysalts (bismuth‐based oxysalts and others) photocatalysts. Moreover, the advanced photocatalytic applications of oxygen vacant semiconductor photocatalysts, such as pollutant removal, H 2 production, CO 2 reduction, N 2 fixation and organic synthesis are systematically summarized. Finally, an overview on the current challenges and a prospective on the future of oxygen vacant materials is proposed.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we report a unique spontaneous charge (electron/hole) separation property in multilayered (BA)2(MA)n-1PbnI3n+1 (BA = CH3(CH2)3NH3+, MA = CH3NH3+) 2D perovskite films by studying the charge carrier dynamics using ultrafast transient absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Surprisingly, the 2D perovskite films, although nominally prepared as \"n = 4\", are found to be mixture of multiple perovskite phases, with n = 2, 3, 4 and ≈ ∞, that naturally align in the order of n along the direction perpendicular to the substrate. Driven by the band alignment between 2D perovskites phases, we observe consecutive photoinduced electron transfer from small-n to large-n phases and hole transfer in the opposite direction on hundreds of picoseconds inside the 2D film of ∼358 nm thickness. This internal charge transfer efficiently separates electrons and holes to the upper and bottom surfaces of the films, which is a unique property beneficial for applications in photovoltaics and other optoelectronics devices.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, these designed devices predominantly utilize glass and plastic substrates, which are expensive and not environmentally friendly. Here, novel transparent and conductive woods (TCWs) were fabricated by using renewable wood substrates and low-cost conductive polymers. Polymerizable deep eutectic solvents (PDES), acrylic-acid (AA)/choline chloride (ChCl), were used as backfilling agents and in situ photopolymerized in the delignified wood, which endowed the materials with high transparency (transmittance of 90%), good stretchability (strain up to 80%), and high electrical conductivity (0.16 S m–1). The retained cellulose orientation and strong interactions between the cellulose-rich template and poly(PDES) endow TCWs with excellent mechanical properties. Moreover, TCWs exhibited excellent sensing behaviors to strain/touch, even at low strain. Therefore, these materials can be used to detect weak pressure such as human being's subtle bending-release activities. This work provides a new route to fabricate functional composite materials and devices which have promising potential for electronics applications in flexible displays, tactile skin sensors, and other fields.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Because of the spatiotemporal variability of miRNA expression level during different cell cycles, signal amplification strategies that can be activated by external stimuli are required to image miRNAs on demand at desired times and selected locations. Herein, we develop a signal amplification strategy termed as the photoactivated DNA walker based on DNA nanoflares, which enables photocontrollable signal amplification imaging of cancer-related miRNA in single living cells. The developed method is achieved via combining photoactivated nucleic acid displacement reaction with the traditional exonuclease III (EXO III)-assisted DNA walker based on DNA nanoflares. This method is capable of on-demand activation of the DNA walker for dictated signal amplification imaging of cancer-related miRNA in single living cells. The developed method was demonstrated as a proof of concept to achieve photoactivated signal amplification imaging of miRNA-21 in single living HeLa cells via selective two-photon irradiation (λ = 740 nm) of single living HeLa cells by using confocal microscopy equipped with a femtosecond laser.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

To exploit the photocytotoxicity and photochemistry of Os-arenes, O,O-chelated complexes [Os(η6-p-cymene)(Curc)Cl] (OsCUR-1, Curc = curcumin) and [Os(η6-biphenyl)(Curc)Cl] (OsCUR-2), and N,N-chelated complexes [Os(η6-biphenyl)(dpq)I]PF6 (OsDPQ-2, dpq = pyrazino[2,3-f][1,10]phenanthroline) and [Os(η6-biphenyl)(bpy)I]PF6 (OsBPY-2, bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine), have been investigated. The Os-arene curcumin complexes showed remarkable photocytotoxicity toward a range of cancer cell lines (blue light IC50: 2.6-5.8 μM, photocytotoxicity index PI = 23-34), especially toward cisplatin-resistant cancer cells, but were nontoxic to normal cells. They localized mainly in mitochondria in the dark but translocated to the nucleus upon photoirradiation, generating DNA and mitochondrial damage, which might contribute toward overcoming cisplatin resistance. Mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, ROS generation, DNA damage, angiogenesis inhibition, and colony formation were observed when A549 lung cancer cells were treated with OsCUR-2. The photochemistry of these Os-arene complexes was investigated by a combination of NMR, HPLC-MS, high energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD), X-ray adsorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, total fluorescence yield (TFY) XANES spectra, and theoretical computation. Selective photodissociation of the arene ligand and oxidation of Os(II) to Os(III) occurred under blue light or UVA excitation. This new approach to the design of novel Os-arene complexes as phototherapeutic agents suggests that the novel curcumin complex OsCUR-2, in particular, is a potential candidate for further development as a photosensitizer for anticancer photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT).\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, amorphous, especially heavy‐atom‐free, RTP materials still suffer from low quantum yield due to the transition‐forbidden character of phosphorescence and the relatively poor suppression of nonradiative transition in amorphous materials. In this study, a series of single‐benzene structure‐based high intersystem crossing yield phosphor is obtained. After embedding into polyvinyl alcohol matrix, all these phosphor exhibits efficient phosphorescence emission (Ф P , up to 44.0%). Besides, photo‐switchable phosphorescence emission can be obtained by doping these molecules into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. The phosphorescence can be gradually switched on by consuming the residual oxygen in the PMMA matrix under continuous UV light irradiation. Furthermore, the phosphorescence will be spontaneously switched off under ambient conditions. Taking advantage of the photoactivation character, this material has potential in information storage and anti‐counterfeiting.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

While it has been shown that FR theory closely follows experimental results for a range of systems, the large number of free parameters required to fit size vs. temperature data make a proper evaluation of the theory difficult. In order to test the applicability of FR theory to microgel particles, we analyse viscosity and light scattering data for PNIPAM microgels as a function of temperature, cross-linking degree (f) and molar mass. In the collapsed state, the polymer volume fraction is estimated to be ϕC ≃ 0.44, independent of cross linking degree and molar mass. Fixing ϕC, f and the θ temperature to independent estimates, the FR model appears to describe microgel swelling well, particularly for high cross-linking densities. Estimates for the various fit parameters differ from earlier reports by an order of magnitude. A comparison of the χ parameter obtained from FR theory with values for the linear polymer reveals that the agreement between experiment and theory is somewhat fortuitous. Although the FR model can accurately describe experimental data, the accuracy of the obtained fit parameters is significantly poorer.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Interconversion is initially driven by photoreversible isomerization of bilin, but how this alteration directs the photostate-dependent changes within the protein to actuate signaling is poorly understood. Here, we describe the structure of the Deinococcus phytochrome photosensory module in its near complete far-red light-absorbing Pfr state. In addition to confirming the 180° rotation of the D-pyrrole ring, the dimeric structure clearly identifies downstream rearrangements that trigger large-scale conformational differences between the dark-adapted and photoactivated states. Mutational analyses verified the importance of residues surrounding the bilin in Pfr stabilization, and protease sensitivity assays corroborated photostate alterations that propagate along the dimeric interface. Collectively, these data support a cooperative \"toggle\" model for phytochrome photoconversion and advance our understanding of the allosteric connection between the photosensory and output modules.Graphical abstract\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In addition to the built‐in field produced by semiconductor heterostructures and the photo‐electrocatalysis realized by applying an external electrical potential to photocatalysts assembled on electrodes, other strategies are waiting to be scientifically explored and understood. In this work, a Lorentz force–assisted charge carrier separation enhancement strategy is reported to improve the photocatalytic efficiency by applying a magnetic field to a photocatalytic system. The photocatalytic efficiency can be improved by 26% just by placing a permanent magnet beneath the normal photocatalytic system without any additional power supply. The mechanism by which the Lorentz force acts oppositely on the photogenerated electrons and holes is introduced, resulting in the suppression of the photoinduced charge recombination. This work provides insights into the specific role of the Lorentz force in suppressing the recombination of electron–hole pairs in their initial photogenerated states. This suppression would increase the population of charge carriers that would subsequently be transported in the semiconductor. It is believed that this strategy based on magnetic effects will initiate a new way of thinking about photoinduced charge separation.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The responses were a result of the spiropyran groups undergoing a reversible isomerization/reaction from a neutral to a charged form. The isomerization process was investigated via experiment and theory. The two-photon excited fluorescence of the spiropyran-modified microgels was also characterized, and their ability to be used to image live cells was determined. Finally, optical devices (etalons) were fabricated using the spiropyran-modified microgels, and the ability of the devices to change color in response to the above-mentioned stimuli was also investigated. We found that the microgel's responsivity was retained in the etalon, which yielded color tunable devices and sensors. This investigation illustrates the versatility of pNIPAm-based microgels and microgel-based etalons and showcases the clear utility of such devices for remote actuation, color tunable optics, sensing, and remotely triggered drug delivery systems.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Hereby, polyelectrolyte microgels with attracted electroactive counterions provide an effective platform for the manipulation of the microgel size by electrochemical means. The reversible switching of guest molecules, namely, hexacyanoferrates, between oxidized ferricyanide [Fe(CN)6]3– and reduced ferrocyanide [Fe(CN)6]4–, influences the cationic host microgel, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride) P(NIPAM-co-MAPTAC), and hence the swelling properties of the microgel. The combination of thermo- and redox-responsiveness in one particle leads to a novel type of multistimuli responsive material. In addition, the use of hydrodynamic voltammetry detects directly the preferred uptake of ferricyanide and enables the determination of the nominal charge ratio (ncr) between microgel and entrapped counterions at different states of switching. Further, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy allows a more detailed mechanistic insight into the microgel modulation.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The carbonyl vibrational stretching frequencies showed slight variations due to the electron-donating or -withdrawing nature of the substituents on the bipyridine. The different substituents had minimal to no influence on the spectral diffusion time scales of the compounds within a particular solvent, but among the three different solvents investigated (DMSO, THF, and CH3CN), we find the spectral diffusion times to correlate with the solvent's donor number (DN). Because the donicity is a measure the Lewis basicity of the solvent, these findings may help establish a more complete dynamical picture of the photocatalysis, where the first chemical step following optical excitation is electron transfer from a sacrificial donor to the rhenium complex.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The complexes bearing the THP and DAPTA ligands exhibit triplet-based luminescence in air-equilibrated aqueous solutions with quantum yields ranging from 3.4 to 11.5%. Furthermore, the THP and DAPTA complexes undergo photosubstitution of a CO ligand upon irradiation with 365 nm light with quantum yields ranging from 1.1 to 5.5% and sensitize the formation of 1O2 with quantum yields as high as 70%. In contrast, all of the complexes bearing the PTA ligand are nonemissive and do not undergo photosubstitution upon irradiation with 365 nm light. These compounds were evaluated as photoactivated anticancer agents in human cervical (HeLa), ovarian (A2780), and cisplatin-resistant ovarian (A2780CP70) cancer cell lines. All of the complexes bearing THP and DAPTA exhibited a cytotoxic response upon irradiation with minimal toxicity in the absence of light. Notably, the complex with DAPTA and 1,10-phenanthroline gave rise to an IC50 value of 6 μM in HeLa cells upon irradiation, rendering it the most phototoxic compound in this library. The nature of the photoinduced cytotoxicity of this compound was explored in further detail. These data indicate that the phototoxic response may result from the release of both CO and the rhenium-containing photoproduct, as well as the production of 1O2.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Herein, we demonstrated a novel single-stimulus dual-drug sensitive nanoplatform, Cur-loaded Dex–Pt(N3) nanoparticles (Cur@DPNs) for enhanced photoactivated therapy. The developed Cur@DPNs could be photoactivated by UVA light to simultaneously generate instant reactive oxygen species from Cur for fast photodynamic therapy and release lasting Pt(II) from Pt(N3) for long-acting photochemotherapy. Compared with small free drugs and individual photoactivated therapy, Cur@DPNs exhibited enhanced photoactivated cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor efficacy with low systemic toxicity accompanied. Therefore, the single-stimulus dual-drug sensitive nanoplatform is convinced to be a promising strategy for multidrug delivery, site-selective and combinational photoactivated therapy in the near future.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In the field of dentistry it is an emerging adjunct to mechanical debridement during endodontic and periodontal treatment. In the present study, we investigate the effect of photoactivated disinfection using riboflavin as a photosensitizer and blue LED light for activation, and compare it to photoactivated disinfection with the widely used combination of toluidine blue O and red light. Riboflavin is highly biocompatible and can be activated with LED lamps at hand in the dental office. To date, no reports are available on the antimicrobial effect of photoactivated disinfection using riboflavin/blue light on oral microorganisms. Planktonic cultures of eight organisms frequently isolated from periodontal and/or endodontic lesions (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherischia coli, Lactobacillus paracasei, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Propionibacterium acnes) were subjected to photoactivated disinfection with riboflavin/blue light and toluidine blue O/red light, and survival rates were determined by CFU counts. Within the limited irradiation time of one minute, photoactivated disinfection with riboflavin/blue light only resulted in minor reductions in CFU counts, whereas full kills were achieved for all organisms when using toluidine blue O/red light. The black pigmented anaerobes P. gingivalis and P. intermedia were eradicated completely by riboflavin/blue light, but also by blue light treatment alone, suggesting that endogenous chromophores acted as photosensitizers in these bacteria. On the basis of our results, riboflavin cannot be recommended as a photosensitizer used for photoactivated disinfection of periodontal or endodontic infections.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

This three-component radical cascade reaction allows an efficient synthesis of a range of perfluoroalkyl containing quinoxalin-2(1H)-one derivatives in moderate to excellent yields under mild conditions. Reactions proceed via acidic aminyl radicals that are readily deprotonated to give the corresponding radical anions able to sustain the radical chain as single electron transfer reducing reagents.

Li-Fi is a VLC, visible light communication, which uses visible light on electromagnetic spectrum for communication. Li-Fi is part of the Visible Light Communications in PAN IEEE 802.15.7 standard. Li-Fi is typically implemented using white LED light bulbs. These devices are normally used for illumination by applying a constant current through the LED. However, by fast and subtle variations of the current, the optical output can be made to vary at extremely high speeds. Unseen by the human eye, this variation is used to carry high-speed data. In our project we are transmitting the audio signal based on visible light communication using LED light bulbs as the medium. We hope that this project leads to an alternative for the use of radio waves in communication purposes.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

The photothermal effect increases the coordination interaction between UO 2 2+ and the functional amidoxime group, and the photoelectric effect produces the surface positive electric field that exhibits electrostatic attraction to the negative [UO 2 (CO 3 ) 3 ] 4− , which all increase the capacity for uranium adsorption. The photocatalytic effect endows the adsorbent with high antibiofouling activity by producing biotoxic reactive oxygen species. Owing to these three photoinduced effects, the photoinduced BP‐PAO fiber shows a high uranium adsorption capacity of 11.76 mg g −1 , which is 1.50 times of the PAO fiber, in bacteria‐containing natural seawater.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In this study, we found that phototropin, a blue-light photoreceptor, perceives temperature via a mechanism based on the photoactivated chromophore’s lifetime to induce appropriate chloroplast positioning in plants. Our findings reveal that the chromophore of phototropin directs chloroplast positioning to optimize photosynthesis in plants by ( i ) sensing blue light and ( ii ) sensing temperature via a temperature-dependent lifetime mechanism. Because many photoreceptors in a range of organisms contain phtoactivatable chromophores with a thermodependent lifetime, the present study suggests that a common molecular principle underlies biological perception of temperature.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here, a photoresponsive azobenzene-containing polymer (azopolymer) is developed for photocontrolled adhesion. The azopolymer P1 (poly(6-(4-(p-tolyldiazenyl)phenoxy)hexyl acrylate)) exhibits photoinduced reversible solid-to-liquid transitions due to trans-cis photoisomerization. Trans P1 is a solid that glues two substrates with a stiffness comparable to that of conventional adhesives. UV light induces trans-to-cis isomerization, liquefies P1, weakens the adhesion, and facilitates the separation of glued substrates. Conversely, visible light induces cis-to-trans isomerization, solidifies P1, and enhances the adhesion. P1 enables photocontrolled reversible adhesion for various substrates with different wettability, chemical compositions, and surface roughness. P1 can also be implemented in both dry and wet environments. Light can control the adhesion process with high spatiotemporal resolution when using P1 as a switchable adhesive. Photoinduced reversible solid-to-liquid transitions represent a strategy for materials recycling and automated production processes that require reversible bonding and debonding.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Generally, this visible-light-promoted decarboxylation process can smoothly occur under mild reaction conditions with a broad range of substrates and an excellent functional-group tolerance. The radical species formed from the decarboxylation step can participate in not only single photocatalytic transformations, but also dual-catalytic cross-coupling reactions by combining photoredox catalysis with other catalytic processes. Recent advances in this research area are discussed herein.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

For the most part, however, these catalysts have contained rare metals such as ruthenium or iridium. Kainz et al. now report a blue light-driven C-N bond-forming reaction catalyzed by Earth-abundant copper (see the Perspective by Greaney).

Here, through developing novel two-dimensional (2D) amorphous TiO2 nanosheets (a-TiO2 NSs), we successfully obtained an ultrahigh enhancement factor of 1.86 × 106. Utilizing the Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) technology, we found that these 2D a-TiO2 NSs possessed more positive surface potential than their 2D crystalline counterpart (c-TiO2 NSs). First-principles density functional theory (DFT) was used to further reveal that the low coordination number of surface Ti atoms and the large amount of surface oxygen defects endowed the 2D a-TiO2 with high electrostatic potential, which allowed significant charge transfer from the adsorbed molecule to the 2D a-TiO2 and facilitated the formation of a stable surface charge-transfer (CT) complex. Significantly, comparing with the 2D c-TiO2, the smaller band gap and higher electronic density of states (DOS) of the 2D a-TiO2 effectively enhanced the vibronic coupling of resonances in the substrate–molecule system. The strong vibronic coupling within the CT complex obviously enhanced the PICT resonance and lead to the remarkable SERS activity of a-TiO2 NSs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the remarkable SERS activity of 2D amorphous semiconductor nanomaterials, which may bring the cutting edge of development of stable and highly sensitive nonmetal SERS technology.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

This study effectively demonstrates that poly- N-isopropylmethacrylamide based microgel coatings prevent bacterial adhesion. The coating preparation via a spraying approach proved to be simple and both cost and time efficient creating a homogeneous dense microgel monolayer. In particular, the influence of cross-linking density, microgel size, and coating thickness was investigated on the initial bacterial adhesion. Adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600 was imaged using a parallel plate flow chamber setup, which gave insights in the number of the total bacteria adhering per unit area onto the surface and the initial bacterial deposition rates. All microgel coatings successfully yielded more than 98% reduction in bacterial adhesion. Bacterial adhesion depends both on the cross-linking density/stiffness of the microgels and on the thickness of the microgel coating. Bacterial adhesion decreased when a lower cross-linking density was used at equal coating thickness and at equal cross-linking density with a thicker microgel coating. The highest reduction in the number of bacterial adhesion was achieved with the microgel that produced the thickest coating ( h = 602 nm) and had the lowest cross-linking density. The results provided in this paper indicate that microgel coatings serve as an interesting and easy applicable approach and that it can be fine-tuned by manipulating the microgel layer thickness and stiffness.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

By analogy with cisplatin, the aquated metal complex is usually presented as the biologically active species, as it can typically bind to DNA. In this work, we show that this qualitative assumption is not necessarily valid by comparing the biological activity, log P, and cellular uptake of three ruthenium-based PACT complexes: [Ru(bpy)2(dmbpy)]2+, [Ru(bpy)2(mtmp)]2+, and [Ru(Ph2phen)2(mtmp)]2+. For the first complex, the photoreleased dmbpy ligand is responsible for the observed phototoxicity, whereas the second complex is not phototoxic, and for the third complex it is the ruthenium bis-aqua photoproduct that is the sole cytotoxic species.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

In this work, we show that the controllable anion exchange can be achieved in a dihalomethane solution of CsPbX3 NC in the absence of any spontaneously reacting anion source using photoexcitation of CsPbX3 NCs as the triggering mechanism for the halide ion exchange. The reaction begins with the photoinduced electron transfer from CsPbX3 NCs to dihalomethane solvent molecules producing halide ions via reductive dissociation, which is followed by anion exchange. The reaction proceeds only in the presence of excitation light and the rate and extent of reaction can be controlled by varying the light intensity. Furthermore, the asymptotic extent of reaction under continuous excitation can be controlled by varying the wavelength of light that self-limits the reaction when light becomes off-resonance with the absorption of NCs. The light-controlled anion exchange demonstrated here can be utilized to pattern the post-synthesis chemical transformation of CsPbX3 NCs, not readily achievable using typical methods of anion exchange.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

This study evaluated the efficacy of 5 intracanal medicaments against mature biofilms of Enterococcus fecalis in vitro : Light activated curcumin, triple antibiotic paste (TAP), double antibiotic paste (DAP), chlorhexidine, calcium hydroxide. Untreated teeth with biofilms served as controls. Confocal microscopy was used to analyse the biofilm mass and percentage of live/dead bacteria within the root canal as well as dentinal tubules. Dentinal shavings obtained from the root canal walls (at 200 and 400 microns depth) were used to quantify the colony forming units/mL. The results showed that light activated curcumin and triple antibiotic paste brought about complete disruption of the biofilm structure (P &lt; 0.05) while chlorhexidine and calcium hydroxide were not significantly different from the control (P &gt; 0.05). Light activated curcumin brought about the highest percentage of dead cells at both depths, but this was not significantly different from triple antibiotic paste (P &gt; 0.05). Curcumin, TAP and DAP brought about a significant reduction of CFU/mL at both depths compared to the control and other groups (P &lt; 0.05). Light activated curcumin brought about a 7 log reduction of bacteria at both depths.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Cytocompatible bottom‐up assembly methods afford the opportunity to assemble microporous systems in the presence of cells and create complex polymer‐cell composite systems in situ. Here, microgel building blocks with clickable surface groups are synthesized for the bottom‐up fabrication of porous cell‐laden scaffolds. The facile nature of assembly allows for human mesenchymal stem cells to be incorporated throughout the porous scaffold. Particles are designed with mean diameters of ≈10 and 100 µm, and assembled to create varied microenvironments. The resulting pore sizes and their distribution significantly alter cell morphology and cytoskeletal formation.

Yet, developing such materials has long been a significant challenge. In this work, we construct an efficient solid-state photoswitch based on a spiropyran-functionalized distyrylanthracene derivative (DSA-2SP) that exhibits exceptional reversible absorption/luminescence modulation ability. Efficient photoswitching between DSA-2SP and its photoisomer DSA-2MC are facilitated by large free volumes induced by nonplanar molecular structures of DSA moieties, as well as the intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the DSA and MC moieties. Consequently, the excellent solid-state photochromic property of DSA-2SP is highly applicable as both anticounterfeiting inks and super-resolution imaging agents.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

However, a lack of knowledge about the nature of instabilities currently represents a major challenge for the development of such materials. Here we investigate the luminescence properties of polycrystalline thin films of lead halide perovskites as a function of the excitation density and the environment. First we demonstrate that in an inert environment photoinduced formation of emissive sub-band gap defect states happens, independently of the chemical composition of the lead halide semiconductor, which quenches the band-to-band radiative emission. Carrier trapping occurs in the subnanosecond time regime, while trapped carriers recombine in a few microseconds. Then, we show that the presence of oxygen, even in a very small amount, is able to compensate such an effect.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Moreover, 6G will provide superior coverage by integrating space/air/underwater networks with terrestrial networks, given that traditional wireless communications are not able to provide high-speed data rates for nonterrestrial networks. Visible light communication (VLC) is a high-speed communication technique with an unlicensed frequency range of 400-800 THz and can be adopted as an alternative approach to solving these problems. In this article, we present the prospects and challenges of VLC in 6G in conjunction with its advances in high-speed transmissions. Recent hot research interests, including new materials and devices, advanced modulation, underwater VLC (UVLC), and signal processing based on machine learning, are also discussed. It is envisaged that VLC will become an indispensable part of 6G given its high-speed transmission advantages and will cooperate with other communication methods to benefit our daily lives.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Layered double hydroxide (LDH)‐based photocatalysts have emerged as one of the most promising candidates to replace TiO 2 ‐based photocatalysts for these reactions , owing to their unique layered structure, compositional flexibility, controllable particle size, low manufacturing cost and ease of synthesis. By introducing defects into LDH materials through the control of their size to the nanoscale, the atomic structure, surface defect concentration, and electronic and optical characteristics of LDH materials can be strategically engineered for particular applications. Furthermore, through the use of advanced characterization techniques such as X‐ray absorption fine structure, positron annihilation spectrometry, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron spin resonance, density‐functional theory calculations, and photocatalytic tests, structure‐activity relationships can be established and used in the rational design of high‐performance LDH‐based photocatalysts for efficient solar energy capture. LDHs thus represent a versatile platform for semiconductor photocatalyst development with application potential across the energy sector.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we use transient absorption spectroscopy to study hot-carrier distributions in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 and quantify key semiconductor parameters. Above bandgap, non-resonant excitation creates quasi-thermalized carrier distributions within 100 fs. During carrier cooling, a sub-bandgap transient absorption signal arises at ∼1.6 eV, which is explained by the interplay of bandgap renormalization and hot-carrier distributions. At higher excitation densities, a ‘phonon bottleneck’ substantially slows carrier cooling. This effect indicates a low contribution from inelastic carrier-impurity or phonon–impurity scattering in these polycrystalline materials, which supports high charge-carrier mobilities. Photoinduced reflectivity changes distort the shape of transient absorption spectra and must be included to extract physical constants. Using a simple band-filling model that accounts for these changes, we determine a small effective mass of m r =0.14 m o , which agrees with band structure calculations and high photovoltaic performance.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Methods: In this interventional cohort study, 20 patients (11 men and 9 women), aged 65.5 (interquartile range = 21.5–78.5) years, who were hospitalized for moderate-sized therapy-resistant bacterial corneal ulcers (11/20 microbiologically confirmed) were treated with hypoosmolar 0.1% riboflavin solution and Ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation for 3 minutes at 30 mW/cm 2 (5.4 J/cm 2 ) as additional therapy to standard antimicrobial treatment. Results: We did not observe any adverse effects of accelerated PACK-CXL on the corneal stroma or limbus. The median ulcer size was 3.00 (2.63–4.50) mm, the median time to reepithelialization was 6.50 (5.00–18.0) days, and the mean hospitalization period was 8.5 ± 4.5 days. Tectonic keratoplasty became necessary in 1 patient (5%). Conclusions: Our results suggest that accelerated PACK-CXL may provide an antimicrobial effect similar to the 1 low-intensity, slow setting (30 minutes at 3 mW/cm 2 ) and may be used as additional treatment in moderate-sized therapy-resistant infectious keratitis.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Corresponding theoretical studies are much scarcer. The review starts with the basics of time-dependent density functional theory, recent developments in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, and the fusion of the two techniques. Ab initio simulations of this kind allow us to directly mimic a great variety of time-resolved experiments performed with pump-probe laser spectroscopies. The focus is on the ultrafast photoinduced charge and exciton dynamics at interfaces formed by two complementary materials. We consider purely inorganic materials, inorganic-organic hybrids, and all organic interfaces, involving bulk semiconductors, metallic and semiconducting nanoclusters, graphene, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, polymers, molecular crystals, molecules, and solvent. The detailed atomistic insights available from time-domain ab initio studies provide a unique description and a comprehensive understanding of the competition between electron transfer, thermal relaxation, energy transfer, and charge recombination processes. These advances now make it possible to directly guide the development of organic and hybrid solar cells, as well as photocatalytic, electronic, spintronic, and other devices relying on complex interfacial dynamics.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

While remarkable progress has been realized in perovskite research in recent years, the focus has been mainly on 3D and 2D structures, with 1D and 0D structures significantly underexplored. The synthesis and characterization of a series of low-dimensional organic tin bromide perovskites with 1D and 0D structures is reported. Using the same organic and inorganic components, but at different ratios and reaction conditions, both 1D (C4N2H14)SnBr4 and 0D (C4N2H14Br)4SnBr6 can be prepared in high yields. Moreover, photoinduced structural transformation from 1D to 0D was investigated experimentally and theoretically in which photodissociation of 1D metal halide chains followed by structural reorganization leads to the formation of a more thermodynamically stable 0D structure.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Here we engineered a genetically encoded synthetic photoactivatable intein (named LOVInC), by using the light-sensitive LOV2 domain from Avena sativa as a switch to modulate the splicing activity of the split DnaE intein from Nostoc punctiforme. Periodic blue light illumination of LOVInC induced protein splicing activity in mammalian cells. To demonstrate the broad applicability of LOVInC, synthetic protein systems were engineered for the light-induced reassembly of several target proteins such as fluorescent protein markers, a dominant positive mutant of RhoA, caspase-7, and the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP2. Spatial precision of LOVInC was demonstrated by targeting activity to specific mammalian cells. Thus, LOVInC can serve as a general platform for engineering light-based control for modulating the activity of many different proteins.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Reported here is a photoinduced radical cascade strategy for the divergent functionalization of amides and protected amines. The process is based on the oxidative generation of electrophilic amidyl radicals and their subsequent transposition by 1,5‐H‐atom transfer, resulting in remote fluorination, chlorination and, for the first time, thioetherification, cyanation, and alkynylation. The process is tolerant of most common functional groups and delivers useful building blocks that can be further elaborated. The utility of this strategy is demonstrated through the late‐stage functionalization of amino acids and a dipeptide.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Meanwhile, the lighting industry has been revolutionized due to the popularization of LED light bulbs, which are more economical and efficient. In that context, visible light communication (VLC) is a disruptive technology based on LEDs that offers a free spectrum and high data rate, which can potentially serve as a complementary technology to the current radio frequency standards. In this paper, we present a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey of VLC, as well as the main concepts and challenges related to this emergent area.

However, a lack of detailed understanding of their mode of action in cells poses a challenge to their development. We have designed a new Ru(II) PDT candidate that efficiently enters cells by incorporation of the lipophilic aromatic pdppz ([2,3-h]dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine) ligand and exhibits photoactivity through incorporation of 1,4,5,8-tetraazaphenanthrene ancillary ligands. Its photoreactivity toward biomolecules was studied in vitro, where light activation caused DNA cleavage. Cellular internalization occurred via an energy dependent mechanism. Confocal and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the complex localizes in various organelles, including the mitochondria. The complex is nontoxic in the dark, with cellular clearance within 96 h; however, upon visible light activation it induces caspase-dependent and reactive-oxygen-species-dependent apoptosis, with low micromolar IC50 values. This investigation greatly increases our understanding of such systems in cellulo, aiding development and realization of their application in cancer therapy.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Two new benzothiophenylisoquinoline (btiq)-derived cyclometalated IrIII complexes, IrL1 and MitoIrL2, were constructed as potent photosensitizers, with the latter being designed for mitochondria accumulation. Both complexes demonstrated a type I PDT process and caused photoinduced ferroptosis in tumor cells under hypoxia. This ferroptosis featured lipid peroxide accumulation, mitochondria shrinkage, down-regulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1)-inhibited cell death. Upon photoirradiation under hypoxia, mitochondria targeting MitoIrL2 caused mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) collapse, ATP production suppression, and induced cell apoptosis. The synergetic effect of ferroptosis and apoptosis causes MitoIrL2 to outperform IrL1 in inhibiting the growth of MCF-7, PANC-1, MDA-MB-231 cells and multicellular spheroids. This study demonstrates the first example of ferroptosis induced by photosensitizing IrIII complexes. Moreover, the synergism of ferroptosis and apoptosis provides a promising approach for combating hypoxic solid tumors through type I PDT processes.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

These entities help form the chemical architecture of natural products, bioactive molecules, synthetic building blocks and catalysts. Due to their ubiquitous presence, the development of strategies for the construction of C-C or C-X bonds through deaminative processes is of high importance. Deaminative methods offer new possibilities on the retrosynthetic rationale, and enable late-stage-functionalization of complex structures. As a result of the recent development of photoinduced processes, a variety of photo-mediated deaminative protocols employing 2,4,6-triphenyl-pyridinium salts - Katritzky Salts - as activating agents have been recently realized. This review covers the most recent developments of deaminative strategies by using Katritzky Salts as alkyl radical reservoirs, with particular concern on photoinduced processes applied to organic synthesis.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

These nodes come in pairs with opposite chiralities. We show that the coupling of circularly polarized photons with these chiral electrons generates a Hall conductivity without any applied magnetic field in the plane orthogonal to the light propagation. This phenomenon comes about because with all three Pauli matrices exhausted to form the three-dimensional linear dispersion, the Weyl nodes cannot be gapped. Rather, the net influence of chiral photons is to shift the positions of the Weyl nodes. Interestingly, the momentum shift is tightly correlated with the chirality of the node to produce a net anomalous Hall signal. Application of our proposal to the recently discovered TaAs family of Weyl semimetals leads to an order-of-magnitude estimate of the photoinduced Hall conductivity which is within the experimentally accessible range.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

We have developed an alternative to the Curtius rearrangement that employs a copper catalyst in combination with blue-LED irradiation to achieve the decarboxylative coupling of aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives (specifically, readily available N-hydroxyphthalimide esters) to afford protected amines under mild conditions.

These materials are also notable for their unusual phase behavior often displaying easily accessible phase transitions. In this work, time-resolved X-ray diffraction, performed on perovskite cesium lead bromide nanocrystals, maps the lattice response to controlled excitation fluence. These nanocrystals undergo a reversible, photoinduced orthorhombic-to-cubic phase transition which is discernible at fluences greater than 0.34 mJ cm-2 through the loss of orthorhombic features and shifting of high-symmetry peaks. This transition recovers on the timescale of 510 ± 100 ps. A reversible crystalline-to-amorphous transition, observable through loss of Bragg diffraction intensity, occurs at higher fluences (greater than 2.5 mJ cm-2). These results demonstrate that light-driven phase transitions occur in perovskite materials, which will impact optoelectronic applications and enable the manipulation of non-equilibrium phase characteristics of the broad perovskite material class.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Nucleic acids consist of chromophores interacting via π stacking and hydrogen bonding. The fate of these systems after they absorb light is determined by the interplay and competition between pathways involving one chromophore or interacting chromophores. This Perspective highlights the role of π stacking in photophysical and photochemical processes in oligonucleotides and reveals the importance of excimers and exciplexes. Special types of excimers/exciplexes, characterized as bonded excimers/exciplexes, are also found to be important.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}

Although considerable advances have recently been achieved in radical-involved catalytic asymmetric C–N bond formation, there has been little progress in the corresponding C–O bond-forming processes. Here, we describe a photoinduced copper-catalyzed cross-coupling of readily available oxime esters and 1,3-dienes to generate diversely substituted allylic esters with high regio- and enantioselectivity (>75 examples; up to 95% ee). The reaction proceeds at room temperature under excitation by purple light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and features the use of a single, earth-abundant copper-based chiral catalyst as both the photoredox catalyst for radical generation and the source of asymmetric induction in C–O coupling. Combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) computational studies suggest the formation of π-allylcopper complexes from redox-active oxime esters as bifunctional reagents and 1,3-dienes through a radical–polar crossover process.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nLABEL RULES:\n- relevant: clear actionable workflow + domain-specific + NOT primarily device performance.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\nSIGNAL DEFINITIONS:\n- workflow_described: explicit procedural / synthesis / iterative steps.\n- multi_objective: two DISTINCT targeted properties with trade or simultaneous optimization (mere metric list without trade context = false).\n- optimization_language: optimize / maximize / improve / enhance / balance / minimize / reduce appear in an optimization context.\n- automation_cue: automated / iterative / high-throughput / platform / closed-loop hints.\n- device_centric: primary emphasis on device performance metrics over chemistry/process.\n- review_like: survey/review style enumeration or meta-summary tone.\nFAILURE REASONS (if label != relevant): [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\nRATIONALE & CONFIDENCE:\n- rationale ≤ 40 tokens; cite 1–3 short quoted phrases evidencing decision.\n- confidence ∈ [0,1]; start baseline 0.5 then: add ~0.2 if multiple strong signals; subtract ~0.2 if conflicts / sparse.\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT:\nReturn ONLY the JSON object conforming to schema — no extra text.\nCONFIDENCE SCALE GUIDANCE:\n0.85–1.00: Clear multi-step workflow + polymer-centric + optimization/iteration cues.\n0.65–0.84: Strong workflow OR strong polymer specificity with minor ambiguity.\n0.45–0.64: Uncertain / partial signals (default region for maybe).\n0.25–0.44: Mostly missing workflow or strongly device-biased but a faint hint remains.\n0.00–0.24: Clearly out-of-scope (review/device-only/theoretical/hype with no actionable steps).\nIf labeling 'maybe', explicitly name 1 missing element preventing 'relevant'.\n"}
