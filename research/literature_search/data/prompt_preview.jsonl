The strain sensor can achieve autonomic self-heal electrically and mechanically under ambient conditions, and can sustain extreme elastic strain (1000%) with high gauge factor of 1.51. Furthermore, the strain sensors have good response, signal stability, and repeatability under various human motion detections. Stretchable, wearable, flexible, and human friendly soft electronic devices are of significance to meet the escalating requirements of increasing complexity and multifunctionality of modern electronics.1-6 Strain sensors can generate repeatable electrical changes upon mechanical deformations. They have found particular interest and broad applications in robotics, sports, health monitor, and therapeutics, etc. To date, several representative strain sensors using carbon nanotubes,7-9 metal/semiconductor,10-12 graphene,13-15 conductive polymer,16, 17 and microfluidic18, 19 as conductive materials combining with elastomeric substrates have been successfully fabricated. However, most of these devices can only be stretched to a very limited extent (usually less than 200%). Lewis and co-workers20 have developed a capacitive soft strain sensor using an ionically conductive fluid and silicone elastomer as the conductor and dielectric/encapsulant respectively, which can be stretched up to 700%, but the gauge factor is small (0.348 ± 0.11). We can define the gauge factor as (ΔR/R0)/ε, where ΔR/R0 is relative resistance change, R0 is the resistance at 0% strain, R is the resistance under stretch, and ε is the applied strain.21 In addition, introducing self-healing properties to these soft electronic devices that can repeatably recover mechanical and electrical performance under room temperature, even at the same damaged location or under extremely stretchable situation, is of high importance to avoid the degradation of the device performance during the deformation. Nowadays, self-healing materials have attracted increasing attention, especially in soft electronics field. Haick and co-workers22 have reported a self-healing flexible sensing platform by dispersing metal particles in polyurethane diol as self-healing electrode. Bao and co-workers23 have demonstrated a self-healing electronic sensor skin based on nanostructured μNi particles-supramolecular organic composite. Park and co-workers24 have developed self-healing conductive hydrogel by polymerizing pyrrole in agarose solution. However, none of these self-healing electronic devices can be stretched over 100%. Recently, there are intense research on highly stretchable hydrogels, which are mainly focusing on ionic conductors due to their excellent transparency and small resistance variation under high stretching states.25-29 In particular, conductive hydrogels are promising materials for the fabrication of ionic skin, bioelectrodes, and biosensors because many hydrogels with high water concentration have biocompatibility properties.24, 30-32 Therefore, it is of great interest to fabricate highly stretchable self-healing strain sensor by combining the advantages of both biocompatible hydrogels and electronic conductors for applications in robotics, human motion detection, entertainment, medical monitoring, and treatment etc. Herein, we introduce a new type of extremely stretchable self-healing piezoresistive strain sensor using different electronic conductors comprised of single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT), graphene, and silver nanowire in self-healing hydrogel (SWCNT, graphene, and silver nanowire/hydrogel) as the conductive sensing channel built on a commercial transparent elastic substrate. The conductive hydrogel exhibits a fast self-healing capability which can restore 98 ± 0.8% of its initial conductivity within 3.2 s healing time. Moreover, no external stimuli (such as heat, pH, light, or catalyst) are required. The fast self-healing process of the SWCNT/hydrogel ensures rapid recovery of the electrical property of the sensor after being released to the relaxed state and avoids the degradation of the device performance during the large deformation. The self-healing strain sensor is capable of monitoring strain, flexion, and twist forces. Moreover, it can measure and withstand strain up to 1000%, with high gauge factor and excellent cycling stability. Based on these key features, the self-healing strain sensor can be used to accurately detect large-scale human motion by embedding it in gloves, garments, or directly attaching it on skin. The present methodology developed paves the way for practical applications of highly stretchable self-healing strain electronic devices. The fabrication process of conductive hydrogel is illustrated in Figure 1a (see the Experimental Section in the Supporting Information for details). Figure 1b illustrates the key reaction in forming crosslinked hydrogel. Borax, the salt of a strong base and a weak acid, is hydrolyzed in aqueous solution, yielding a boric acid/tetrafunctional borate ion. In the gelation experiments, trigonal planar B(OH)3 and tetrahedral B(OH)4− exist as monomeric species due to the low concentration of borax employed (0.02 m). B(OH)3 is capable of complexing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), however, it cannot produce polyol gels. The main reason is that the complexation reaction occurs through the attachment of boron to adjacent alcohol groups of the same polymeric chain and this prevents cross-linking from taking place. Therefore, the crosslinked hydrogel is formed via tetrafunctional borate ion interaction with –OH group of PVA. The process is particularly effective in forming 3D gel networks. The hydrogen-bonding between tetrafunctional borate ion and –OH group provides the self-healing function because the cross-link is so weak that it is neither resemblance of covalent bond character nor esterification involved.33-35 The hydrogen-bonding can be easily broken and reformed, allowing the hydrogel to self-heal and reform. The cross-links are dynamically associated and dissociated readily under room temperature. The network cross-linked by weak hydrogen-bonding is easily disrupted by a mechanical deformation, however, it is relatively facile for the bonds to reform due to proximity of plenty –OH groups and borate ions, hence allowing self-healing at room temperature. In addition, the PVA-borax hydrogel exhibits non-Newtonian behavior, resulting in flow under low stress and limited dimensional stability.35, 36 Therefore, the sufficient mobility of polymer chain and free tetrafunctional borate ions enables the hydrogen bond across broken interfaces to trigger the self-healing process rapidly and without the need of external stimuli. Although the PVA itself can form hydrogel and autonomously self-healing property according to the previous reports, the concentration of the PVA used is very high and the stretchability is limited.37-39 Before forming the hydrogel, SWCNT and 4 wt% PVA solution were homogeneously mixed under the surfactant assistance of BYK 348 which is a polyether modified siloxane (purchased from BYK-Chemie GmbH). The SWCNT and water are wrapped in the 3D networks during the hydrogel crosslinking process, thereby the conductive self-healing hydrogel was formed as shown in Figure 1c. It is worth noting that most of the free volume (or pores) within the hydrogel is taken up by water. The hydrogel is composed of water with weight percentage more than 95 wt%. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs taken from freeze-dried SWCNT/hydrogel are shown in Figure 1d,e. The microstructure of the freeze-dried SWCNT/hydrogel is 3D porous networks cross-linked by the SWCNT and some immobilized polymer. The porous structure of the SWCNT and polymeric network inside the SWCNT/hydrogel is highly beneficial to the stretchability and facilitating rapid response of hydrogels. In order to reveal the interactions between the PVA and tetrafunctional borate ion, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) experiment was conducted on Spectrum GX FTIR Spectrometer. As shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information), the broad and strong peak around 3400 cm−1 is attributed to the symmetrical stretching vibration of –OH groups. The –OH stretching peak is sensitive to hydrogen bonding. Compared with pure PVA, the –OH stretching peak shifts to a higher wavenumber and the peak is enhanced after formation of the hydrogel, indicating the presence of hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups on the PVA molecular chains and tetrafunctional borate ion.40, 41 In addition, dynamic mechanical measurements of the pure hydrogel and SWCNT/hydrogel were carried out to investigate their rheological properties. Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows the changes in the storage (G′, solid symbols) and loss modulus (G″, hollow symbols) as a function of angular frequency for hydrogel and SWCNT/hydrogel. It can be seen that the presence of SWCNT raises the moduli and enhances the elastic response of the hydrogel. In addition, both hydrogels have a solid behavior with the storage modulus exceeding the loss modulus over the entire frequency range. Figure 2a1–a3 shows the representative optical microscope images of how the SWCNT/hydrogel was healed after being completely separated by a scapel. The two fractured surfaces rapidly contact each other after the scapel was removed. The cutting groove was partially healed after 30 s and totally restored to normal after 60 s at room temperature without any external assistance (such as heat, light, and force). To further investigate the healing property of the SWCNT/hydrogel and recovery of the conductivity, the SWCNT/hydrogel was completely bifurcated and then the two furcated parts were rapidly brought together. Figure 2b presents the resistance changes over time of the SWCNT/hydrogel during the cutting and healing process. Once the conductive hydrogel was completely cut off, an open circuit was formed and the resistance changed to infinity. As the two furcated parts were brought together, the resistance dropped quickly and the resistance reached a constant value within 3.2 s. In addition, the self-healing efficiency of the SWCNT/hydrogel was calculated by Rr/Ri (Rr is the recovered conductivity and Ri is the initial conductivity). Rr/Ri is 98.6% after healing for 3.2 s. It is worth noting that the resistance is lower than that of original value at the moment the two furcated parts get in contact, which is due to the transfer of free ions in the hydrogel, similar phenomenon was observed in the reduced graphene oxide based hydrogel.42 Figure 2c shows the repetitive cutting-healing processes with five cycles at the same location. The resistance of the sample is relatively stable during the cycling. The high self-healing efficiency was observed in each cutting-healing process (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The average efficiencies are 98 ± 0.8% for the five self-healing cycles within about 3.2 s, indicating the SWCNT/hydrogel possesses significant and repeatable electrical restoration performance. The self-healing property of SWCNT/hydrogel was also demonstrated on a complete circuit composed of a LED indicator with SWCNT/hydrogel as the conductor, as shown in Figure 2d1–d3. The LED indicator was successfully lighted when a driving voltage of 5 V was applied. The LED indicator was extinguished when the SWCNT/hydrogel was completely bifurcated and the circuit became open-circuit state. Once the two furcated parts were partially brought together, the circuit was restored and the LED indicator could be lighted up again. The demonstration here illustrates that the SWCNT/hydrogel has great potential in applications of self-healing electronic device such as biosensors, electronic skin, wearable electronics, and so on. To evaluate the performance of the strain sensor, we realized the self-healing piezoresistive strain sensor using the SWCNT/hydrogel as conductor, and Scotch permanent clear mounting tape (VHB 4010, 3 m) as elastomeric substrates and encapsulant, as shown in Figure 3a. The high stretchability of both SWCNT/hydrogel and VHB tape allowed the self-healing strain sensor to remain intact up to 1000% strain, the highest value for electronic strain sensor so far, to the best of our knowledge.43-45 The excellent performances of the device are derived from all parts of the device or their coordination with each other. Although the SWCNT/hydrogel itself could not be recovered to the initial state under extreme strain conditions, it can work well when attached to the VHB tape. A strain sensor using the hydrogel without the electronic conducting component (SWCNT) was also prepared on the elastic substrate with the same parameters for comparison. Relative resistance changes versus strains are shown in Figure 3b. The relative resistance change increases with increasing tensile strain. A relative resistance change [(R −R0)/R0 = ΔR/R0, R0 is the resistance at 0% strain, R is the resistance under stretch] of 1514% was observed at 1000% strain for SWCNT/hydrogel, the sensitivity is nearly three times higher than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor (533%). The large resistance change is highly desired for strain sensing applications, which is prerequisite for high sensitivity. Moreover, the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor also showed reproducible and reliable responses to the small strain from 2% to 100% (Figure S4, Supporting Information). These results indicate that the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor can work well from small strain to extreme strain. There are two aspects leading to the piezoresistive effects of SWCNT/hydrogel: one is the intrinsic piezoresistivity of the hydrogel, the other is the change of the contact conditions of SWCNT for electron conduction, such as contact area, loss of contacts and spacing variations upon stretching, and so on. The electrical conductivity of hydrogel without electronic conductor comes from ions conductivity (such as Na+, H+ in the hydrogel).26, 32 In addition, the relative resistance changes versus strains of the strain sensor can fit into a parabolic equation y = Aε2 + Bε + C, where y is the relative resistance changes and ε is the tensile strain.23, 46 There is no relative resistance change when there is no strain applied to the sensor, so C is zero in the equation. Moreover, the value A can be defined as the sensitivity factor. Larger A value leads to more relative resistance changes, corresponding to higher sensitivity in the sensor. Hence, the sensitivity of the strain sensor can be quantified by the equation in Figure 3b. It can be seen that the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor possesses a larger A than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor. Therefore, the sensitivity of the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor is higher than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor, which is consistent with the experimental data. Figure S5 (Supporting Information) shows the photographs of the SWCNT/hydrogel based self-healing strain sensor stretched to different strains. Gauge factor represents the sensitivity of the sensors. Usually, brittle or poorly stretchable conductive materials have higher gauge factor. However, these materials do not possess or only sustain small stretchability. A relatively small strain could result in an irreversible fracture and lead to an infinite gauge factor. In the cases that high stretchability is required, the gauge factor of SWCNT/hydrogel was 0.24 at 100% strain and increased to 1.51 at 1000% strain (Figure S6, Supporting Information). The gauge factor is higher than that of the hydrogel without electronic conductor (from 0.09 at 100% strain to 0.53 at 1000% strain), and other piezoresistive electronic strain sensor (0.06 at 200% strain)8 and capacitive soft strain sensors based on ionic conductor (0.348 ± 0.11 at 700% strain).20 Although some strain sensors exhibit much higher gauge factors, the poor stretchability and lack of self-healing capability restrict their applications under rigorous mechanical deformations.47-49 The responses of the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor for other types of deformation such as flexion and twist which are related to human body movements were also tested. Figure 3c displays the resistance change as a function of flexion angle for the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor. When the sensor was flexed, tensile stress built up at the outer curvature and compressive force built at the inner curvature. The conductive SWCNTs are separated from one another at the outer curvature and approached closer to one another at the inner curvature. However, the separated SWCNT played a dominant role for the device, thereby the resistance increased with increasing flexion angle. It can be seen that the resistance increased to 118% from its original value with bending angle increasing from 0° to 150°. When the strain sensor was twisted, the resistance changes versus twist angle still obeys the flexion parabolic equation within the twist angle of less than 540° as shown in the Figure 3d. However, the conductive SWCNT will be separated from one another around the twist point under larger twist angle (more than 540°), hence, the resistance of the device rapidly increases with increasing twist angle that detaches the SWCNT contacts or entanglements. The sensor responds to the twist angle with a good sensitivity, the resistance increases to 457% from the value of the untwisted state after two revolutions (720°) as shown in Figure 3d. The stability of the sensor was also investigated by repeatedly applying 700% stretching strain to the sensor and the resistance was measured at the released state (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The resistance of the sensor remains almost constant with minor fluctuations within 10% within the first 700 cycles strain test (between 0% to 700% strain). However, the largest resistance fluctuations were observed after 700 cycles due to partial water evaporation of the hydrogel during the long-term cycles. The loss of water from hydrogels might become significant in long-term cycles, which can be reduced by an appropriate encapsulation. Finding ideal packaging materials and technology for long lifetimes is a large undertaking beyond the scope of this paper. We suggest that SWCNT/hydrogel with 1000% stretchability is a superior candidate for strain sensing applications, considering the fast self-healing property and significantly improved piezoresistive responses compared to the hydrogel without electronic conductor counterparts. The excellent sensing performances were not only observed in SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor, but could also be achieved on graphene/hydrogel based strain sensor and silver nanowire/hydrogel based strain sensor (Figure S8 and Figure S9, Supporting Information). A relative resistance change of 916% and gauge factor of 0.92 were observed at 1000% strain for graphene/hydrogel. The silver nanowire/hydrogel based strain sensor exhibits high relative resistance change of 2249% and gauge factor of 2.25 at 1000% strain. However, the silver nanowire/hydrogel based strain sensor is not stable due to the easy oxidation of silver nanowires in water and air. The results indicate that the outstanding sensor performance can be obtained on various electronic conductor/hydrogel based strain sensors. The self-healing SWCNT/hydrogel is promising material platform for wearable strain sensor. For demonstration, the SWCNT/hydrogel based sensor was mounted on the white cotton glove, garment, or directly attached on the skin to detect the bending and stretching of the human body, such as finger knuckle, knee joint, neck and elbow joint. Figure 4a shows the motion detection for the index finger. We checked the response behaviors of the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor when the fingers were repeatedly bent at a frequency of 1 Hz. It can be seen that the sensor responded to the motion of the finger rapidly and repeatedly. The background noise is corresponding to the slight trembling of the finger that can be detected by the SWCNT/hydrogel strain sensor, indicating the high sensitivity of the sensor. Figure 4b illustrates the detection of knee joint bending, the sensor is stretched when the bending angles are at 79.8°, 92.5°, 122.7°, respectively, and released when straightening the knee, the resistance increases during the bending and recover during the releasing process. It can be seen that the resistance of the sensor increased as the bending angle increased. Moreover, the sensor is capable of distinguishing the different bending angles of the knee. When the knee was held at a certain angle, the resistance of SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor remained at a constant value and returned to the original value after straightening the knee. Furthermore, when the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensor was used to further monitor other human-motion such as neck bending and elbow bending, sharp and rapid responses were also observed as shown in Figure 4c,d, respectively. Although a slight drift is noticed in these responses, the sensor exhibited good stability and repeatability in the signal. The hysteresis of the sensor in the response could lead to the signal drift. Figure S10 (Supporting Information) depicts the relative resistance changes of 1000% and 100% strain under stretching–releasing cycles, significant hysteresis is observed during the 1000% stretching–releasing cycling. The hysteresis is caused by rearrangement of the CNT in the hydrogel matrix and the considerable hysteresis of VHB tape. However, even in this case, the original resistance of the sensor is almost fully recovered after releasing it from strain and the hysteresis is negligible within 100% strain. Moreover, the sensor also has important advantages of low creep and fast response. As seen in Figure S11 (Supporting Information), a step strain of 100% was imposed within 1 s, revealing a percent overshoot and creep recovery time of 7.4% and 0.7 s, respectively, which can be attributed to the excellent self-healing property of the conductive SWCNT/hydrogel. The differences in the degree of muscle movements could lead to a slight drift. In order to prove this, the response behavior of the sensor was also investigated by repeatedly applying 100% stretching strain to the sensor as shown in Figure S12 (Supporting Information). It can be seen that the sensor exhibits a negligible drift under the constant strain. These results demonstrate that our strain sensors can be used as human motion sensor and have the potential application in a wide range of stretchable devices. In summary, the present work first demonstrated the extremely stretchable self-healing strain sensors based on various repeatable self-healing conductive hydrogels such as SWCNT, graphene, and silver nanowire/hydrogel under ambient conditions. The conductive SWCNT/hydrogel exhibits fast electrical healing speed (within 3.2 s) and high self-healing efficiency (98 ± 0.8%). The strain sensor is capable of sustaining severe elastic deformation (up to 1000%) with high gauge factor of 1.51. After being stretched to 700% strain for 1000 cycles, no significant change was observed in the intrinsic properties of the strain sensor. The electrical resistance can effectively recover by self-healing of the conductive SWCNT/hydrogel. Furthermore, the strain sensor could effectively monitor and distinguish multifarious human motion when used as wearable strain sensor. We found that the SWCNT/hydrogel based strain sensors have good response, stability, and repeatability of the signal during the human motion detection measurements. We believe that our extremely stretchable self-healing strain sensor could find a wide range of applications in robotics, sports, health monitoring, and medical treatments.

A new trimethylaluminum vapor-based crosslinking method to render the nanocrystal films insoluble is applied. The resulting near-complete nanocrystal film coverage, coupled with the natural confinement of injected charges within the perovskite crystals, facilitates electron–hole capture and give rise to a remarkable electroluminescence yield of 5.7%. Metal-halide perovskite semiconductors have attracted significant research interest, due to a combination of low-cost solution processability and remarkable performance in optoelectronic devices.1, 2 In 2014, we demonstrated infrared and visible electroluminescence in methylammonium lead halide perovskites, using a charge-confined diode structure to achieve effective radiative recombination.2-4 However, the use of methylammonium halide, which is a chemical combination of gaseous methylamine and hydrogen halide, necessarily limits the thermal stability of these perovskite devices. Replacing methylammonium with inorganic cesium offers the perovskite extra thermal stability up to its melting at ≈500 °C, but makes it more intractable toward solution processing.5 Recently, Protesescu et al. demonstrated the synthesis of cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals,6 following the traditional approaches of growing and stabilizing semiconductor particles in the presence of aliphatic ligands.7 These perovskite nanocrystals are highly luminescent and emit over the full visible range, making them ideal candidates for luminescent display applications.6 The synthetic steps are generally straightforward, and the easy control of halide content allows the perovskite bandgaps to be tailored, both by chemical compositions as well as by quantum size effects. So far, perovskite nanocrystals are shown to have color-pure emission, close to unity photoluminescence yield and low lasing thresholds.8 These nanocrystals were also attempted in light-emitting devices, but efficiencies remain modest at 0.12%.9 Here, we show the preparation of highly efficient perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLED) using solution-processed nanocrystals. We apply a new trimethylaluminum (TMA) vapor-based crosslinking method to render the nanocrystal films insoluble, thereby allowing the deposition of subsequent charge-injection layers without the need for orthogonal solvents. The resulting near-complete nanocrystal film coverage, coupled with the natural confinement of injected charges within the perovskite crystals, facilitate electron–hole capture and give rise to a remarkable electroluminescence yield of 5.7%. Figure 1a shows the device architecture of our perovskite nanocrystal light-emitting diode, and Figure 1b shows the energy-level diagram of the materials within the device stack. Here, our electron-injection layer comprises a film of zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocrystals, directly deposited on an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate.4 The cesium lead halide nanocrystals were solution-coated onto the ZnO film as the emissive layer. Due to the presence of aliphatic ligands on the nanocrystals, the perovskite film remains soluble to organic solvents, which limits the deposition of subsequent charge-injection layers using solution methods. We employed a new TMA vapor-phase crosslinking technique to fix the nanocrystal film in place, thereby enabling us to solution-cast a layer of TFB polymer (poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(4,4′-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine)]) above without washing the nanocrystals off. TFB serves primarily as a hole-injection and electron-blocking layer. A thin, high work-function molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) interlayer and silver electrode were vacuum-thermal evaporated to complete the device. As shown in Figure 1c,d, our perovskite nanocrystal devices show saturated and color-pure emission. We control the perovskite bandgap, primarily by tailoring the halide composition, and achieve electroluminescence across a wide range of the visible spectrum. Our red, orange, green, and blue devices emit at wavelengths of 698, 619, 523, and 480 nm, respectively. All devices exhibit narrow-width emission, with their full-width at half maxima (FWHM) in the range of 17–31 nm. The red and green LEDs were made, respectively, from the pure iodide and pure bromide perovskites, while the orange and blue LEDs were made from mixed-halide perovskites, with CsPbI2.25Br0.75 and CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5 compositions, respectively. The crosslinking of the perovskite nanocrystals was critical toward the realization of our device structure. Traditionally, nanocrystals have been crosslinked, or made insoluble, using ligand exchange techniques, where shorter-chain bi-functionalized organic ligands (e.g., diamines or dithiols) were applied to replace the longer-chain oleyl ligands.11 However, the replacement with smaller ligands often creates cracks and gaps within the nanocrystal film, which could lead to electrical shunts and reduced device performance.12 Closer packing of the nanocrystals could also lead to the self-quenching of the nanocrystals and a lower photoluminescence yield,13 often caused by a more effective Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET) to non-radiative sites.14 Here, crosslinking is achieved by exposing the perovskite nanocrystal film to short pulses of TMA vapor within an enclosed vacuum chamber at room temperature, followed by standing the treated film in ambient air. This creates a well-connected network of hydroxide-terminated aluminum oxide that links the nanocrystals together, hence rendering them insoluble. This vapor-phase technique does not involve ligand exchange processes, and is therefore useful in crosslinking the nanocrystals without altering the original crystal arrangements, thereby allowing much of the film's original structural and electronic properties to be preserved. The photoluminescence spectra of the nanocrystals also remain unchanged after the TMA treatment, hence confirming that the crosslinking has no effect on their optical bandgap. (Note that we use a slightly modified TMA treatment procedure for the blue-emitting nanocrystals—see Figure S1, Supporting Information.) In order to investigate the effectiveness of crosslinking, we varied the exposure of the perovskite nanocrystals to different pulse durations of TMA vapor, and measured the nanocrystal retention upon washing with toluene. The crystal retention ratio was determined using UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 2a, the crosslinking was remarkably rapid even at room temperature, and a near complete retention of nanocrystals was achieved in less than 0.5 s of TMA exposure. The inset scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show a significant wash-off for the non-crosslinked nanocrystals, while the TMA-treated nanocrystals were completely retained after washing. Detailed SEM images and large area scans of the nanocrystal films, upon washing with different organic solvents, are shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). Interestingly, we observe a corresponding increase in the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 with TMA treatment, but a decrease in the case of CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5 (see Figure 2b). This PL enhancement is particularly remarkable for the CsPbI3 nanocrystals, raising its PL by more than a factor of 3, from ≈25% in the untreated film to ≈85% in the TMA-treated film. We note that this is possibly one of the highest PLQEs achieved in a non-core–shell structured nanocrystal thin film. In an attempt to unravel the origins of the PL enhancement, we took high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Figure 2c) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images (Figure 2d) of the CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals before and after the TMA treatment, and further analyzed the distribution of main elements within the samples using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectrum imaging (Figure 2e). The nanocrystals show an average size of 19 nm (see Figure S3, Supporting Information), which points to minimal quantum confinement in their electronic bandgap.6 We analyzed the spacing distribution between the nanocrystals in the HRTEM images, and found the average crystal spacing to increase from 1.6 to 1.9 nm upon TMA treatment. We note that a spacing of 1.6 nm between the crystals represents ≈0.55 ligand attachment per unit cell of the perovskite lattice. The spacing distribution analysis is shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information) and further TEM images of CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). By analyzing the EELS spectrum image using a combination of principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and curve-fitting quantification, we were able to map out the distribution of elements, and precisely identify the higher concentrations of aluminum and oxygen elements within the sub-2 nm gaps between the perovskite nanocrystals (Figure 2e). This indicates that the TMA treatment has successfully created an alumina network that covers all areas surrounding and in-between the nanocrystals. The intercalation of alumina among the ligands, therefore, accounts for the small increase in the crystal spacing. While this 0.3 nm increase in spacing may lead to a smaller degree of PL quenching by FRET, it is unlikely to fully account for the threefold enhancement in PL yield. The changes in PL are therefore likely to be chemical in nature, where the introduction of TMA chemically passivates the nanocrystal surface and leads to a reduction in PL-quenching defects.15 To further verify that the aluminum is incorporated between the crystal spacing and not just above the nanocrystal film, we measured the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the sample as a function of film depth, and found aluminum to be quite evenly distributed throughout the entire nanocrystal film thickness (see XPS depth profile in Figure S5, Supporting Information). To elucidate the chemical crosslinking mechanism, we measured the infrared (IR) transmittance spectra of the nanocrystal samples before and after the TMA treatment. For comparison, we also measured the IR spectra of the organic ligands, and plotted them on the same graph in Figure 3a. Three distinct changes could be observed in the IR spectra following the TMA treatment. i) A broad peak centered around 3450 cm−1 is produced in all the TMA-treated samples, signally the presence of O–H stretch. This confirms hydroxide surface terminations as expected for an AlOx network, and the role of ambient water in the crosslinking process. ii) Another broad peak appears around 630 cm−1, and this is characteristic of vibrational modes in alumina.16 iii) A strong and sharp band appears at 1576 cm−1 (for samples containing oleic acid), which can be assigned to weakened C=O stretching. This is particularly clear in the case of TMA-treated oleic acid. It is likely that the bonding of the carboxylate group to the strongly Lewis acidic aluminum causes the C=O bond to be weakened, thereby giving a lower than usual stretching frequency. Interestingly, the C=O stretching band does not appear in the pristine nanocrystal samples, but only emerges after TMA treatment. This is likely to be due to the coordination of the carboxylate group to the nanocrystals, thereby diminishing its oscillator strength. With this information, we propose a reaction mechanism for the cross-linking process as shown in Figure 3b. The introduction of TMA coordinates and reacts with the carboxylate and amino groups of the ligands, adjacent to the nanocrystals. The subsequent exposure to ambient moisture hydrolyzes the remaining methyl-aluminum to give a network of alumina and aluminum hydroxide that are covalently bonded to the ligands. It is likely that the alumina that is formed next to the crystal surface successfully passivates the surface defects, thereby enhancing the crystals' photoluminescence yield. The strongly reactive TMA appears to be benign toward the iodide and bromide perovskites, but causes some level of damage to the chloride perovskites, hence resulting in a degradation of PL in the latter. To further verify the role of ligands in this crosslinking process, we attempted to wash off TMA-treated oleic acid and oleylamine (i.e., no nanocrystals) with toluene. We show in Figure S6 (Supporting Information) that the ligands were crosslinked and insoluble upon TMA treatment, hence indicating that many of the ligands are chemically incorporated into the alumina network across the nanocrystal film. In order to prove the generality of our crosslinking technique, we treated thin films of CdSe and PbS nanocrystals with TMA, and demonstrate them to be insoluble to organic solvents upon treatment (see Figure S7, Supporting Information). The TMA crosslinking method has enabled us to make high-performance light-emitting devices using these nanocrystalline lead halide perovskites. Figure 4a–d shows the detailed device characteristics of our perovskite nanocrystal LEDs. High luminance levels of 2335 and 1559 cd m−2 were achieved in our green and orange-emitting devices, respectively, at current densities of 831 and 852 mA cm−2. As shown in Figure 4b, charge injection turns on efficiently close to the bandgap voltage of the perovskite. To demonstrate the importance of our crosslinking method, we plotted the current–voltage characteristics of the non-TMA-treated CsPbI3 device, and show that the current density is more than an order of magnitude higher than the crosslinked counterpart, even at similar or lower luminance levels. This is a clear indication of current leakage,3 which is a result of voids created from the wash-off of the perovskite nanocrystals. We achieved remarkable external quantum efficiencies (EQE), as high as 5.7%, in the crosslinked red-emitting CsPbI3 device, more than an order of magnitude higher than the non-crosslinked device (see Figure 4c) and a factor of 50 higher than the previous report.9 Correcting for out-coupling losses,17 this would be equivalent to an internal quantum efficiency of ≈26%. We note that our CsPbI3 device emits at 698 nm, close to the edge of human-eye sensitivity, and therefore gives only a modest luminance level of 206 cd m−2 at a current density of 755 mA cm−2. We observed that the EQE of the nanocrystal devices decrease generally with the widening of the perovskite bandgap. This is in line with the trends of a lower PLQE in our green and blue-emitting materials (see Figure 2b). The less-ideal charge injection into larger bandgap perovskites could also result in the lower device efficiencies. Figure 4d gives a summary of the key performance parameters of our nanocrystal LEDs. During our investigation of the mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbI2.25Br0.75 and CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5), we noticed that their emission red-shifts reversibly during device operation, and return slowly toward their original state after resting (see Figure S8, Supporting Information). This emission shift is not observed in the pure-halide samples. This may be related to previous observations on photoluminescence shifts in mixed-halide perovskites upon photoexcitation, which was suggested to be due to phase segregation into purer halide phases.18 We note that our films consist of spatially separated nanocrystals, and any phase segregation or halide rearrangements could therefore occur only within a small domain of less than 20 nm. We further show in Figure S9 (Supporting Information) that the EL shifts are completely consistent with the PL shifts, thereby confirming that these shifts are a result of intrinsic changes within the perovskites, and not due to a change in the device charge-injection properties during operation. In view of the emission shifts in mixed-halide systems, bandgap tuning of pure-halide perovskites via quantum size effect may emerge as the more successful strategy for consumer display applications, where stringent requirements on emission stability are demanded. We have now successfully departed from the traditional core–shell nanocrystal approach, and shown that highly efficient electroluminescence could be realized in semiconductor nanocrystals using a simple TMA crosslinking technique. The remarkable ability of alumina to double as a surface passivating agent further makes the TMA treatment an attractive technique for the fabrication of quantum-dot optoelectronic devices. Indeed, given their intensely luminescent properties, versatile color tuning, coupled with an enhanced thermal stability, these all-inorganic lead halide perovskites may quickly emerge as strong contenders in the color display industry. Materials: TFB was provided by Cambridge Display Technology (CDT) and was used as received. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, and were used as received. Synthesis of CsPbX3 (X =Cl, Br, I) Nanocrystals: Perovskite nanocrystals were synthesized using previously reported procedures.6 Cs2CO3 (0.814g, 99.9%) was loaded into 100 mL three-neck flask along with octadecene (ODE) (30 mL, 90%) and oleic acid (OA) (2.5 mL, 90%), and the mixture was dried for 2 h at 120 °C under N2. The solution temperature was then lowered to 100 °C. ODE (75 mL), oleylamine (OLA) (7.5 mL, 90%), and dried OA (7.5 mL) and PbX2 (2.82 mmol) such as PbI2 (1.26 g, 99.99%), PbBr2 (1.035 g, 99.99%), PbCl2 (0.675g, 99.99%), or their mixtures were loaded into a 250 mL three-neck flask and dried under vacuum for 2 h at 120 °C. After complete solubilization of the PbX2 salt, the temperature was raised to 170 °C and the Cs-oleate solution (6.0 mL, 0.125 m in ODE, prepared as described above) was quickly injected. After 10 s, the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice-water bath. For CsPbCl3 synthesis, 1 mL of trioctylphosphine (TOP) (97%) was added to solubilize PbCl2. The nanocrystals were precipitated from solution by the addition of equal volume anhydrous butanol (BuOH) (99%) (ODE:BuOH = 1:1 by volume). After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the nanocrystals were redispersed in anhydrous hexane (99%) and precipitated again with the addition of BuOH (hexane:BuOH = 1:1 by volume). These were redispersed in hexane. The nanocrystal dispersion was filtered through a 0.2 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter and diluted to 10 mg mL−1 in hexane before use. Synthesis of ZnO Nanocrystals: Colloidal ZnO nanocrystals were synthesized by a solution-precipitation process according to previously reported procedures.19 Typically, zinc acetate dihydrate (329 mg) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (0.5 m) by stirring at room temperature. A solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) (453 mg) in ethanol (5 mL) was then added dropwise within 5 min. After 2 h, the product mixture was decanted and washed twice with ethyl acetate and ethanol. Ethanol (6 mL) was added to disperse the precipitate and produce a colloidal ZnO nanocrystal dispersion with a concentration of ≈7 mg mL−1. The dispersion was filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter before use. Crosslinking of Perovskite Nanocrystals: A BENEQ TFS20 atomic layer deposition (ALD) system was used for the vapor-phase crosslinking treatment. High-purity TMA was purchased from SAFC Hitech. The deposition temperature was set at 18 ± 1 °C, which is also the typical ambient room temperature. The reactor chamber was pumped down below 0.2 mbar before starting the process. TMA was applied in short pulses at a partial pressure of ≈0.01 mbar. The dosage of TMA was controlled by varying the total length of TMA pulses between 0.25 and 20 s. The duration of each pulse was limited to 1 s, hence a 10 s dosage is, for instance, achieved with 10 × 1 s pulses. LED Device Fabrication: A 7 mg mL−1 dispersion of ZnO nanocrystals in ethanol was spin-coated onto an ITO-coated glass substrate at 1500 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min in a nitrogen-filled glovebox to give a 15 nm film. A 10 mg mL−1 perovskite nanocrystal dispersion in hexane was spin-coated at 1000–2000 rpm for 20 s in air to give a 30–50 nm film. The films were allowed to dry in air for ≈10 min, and were transferred into the ALD chamber for crosslinking treatment. Following the crosslinking step, a solution of TFB in toluene (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite nanocrystals at 2000 rpm for 30 s in the glovebox to give a 60 nm thin film. MoO3 (5 nm) and Ag (80 nm) metal layers were deposited by thermal evaporation in a high vacuum of below 5 × 10−6 mbar. The devices were encapsulated by UV-epoxy. LED Characterization: Current versus voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. The photon flux was measured simultaneously using a calibrated silicon photodiode centered over the light-emitting pixel. Luminance in cd m−2 was calculated based on the emission spectrum of the LED, weighted against the standard luminosity function and on the known spectral response of the silicon photodiode. The external quantum efficiency was calculated assuming a Lambertian emission profile. Electroluminescence spectra were measured using a Labsphere CDS-610 spectrometer. Optical Characterization: In the PL measurements, the nanocrystal films were placed in a nitrogen-flushed integrating sphere and were photoexcited using a 405 nm continuous-wave laser (1.5 mW). The laser and the emission signals were measured and quantified using a calibrated Andor iDus DU490A InGaAs detector for the determination of PL quantum efficiency. UV–visible absorption of the nanocrystal films was measured using an HP 8453 spectrometer. Samples were prepared on fused-silica substrate, using same processing parameters as in device fabrication. FTIR Measurements: Mid-IR FTIR data were measured by an Agilent Technologies Cary 600 Series FTIR spectrometer. Nanocrystals were spin-coated onto a KBr substrate, and measured in the wavenumber range of 5000–500 cm−1. Electron Microscopy: TEM characterization was carried out on close-packed CsPbI3 and CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that were drop-cast on thin TEM carbon grids. The TEM samples were analyzed in an FEI Tecnai Osiris TEM/STEM 80-200 microscope operated at 200 kV. The HAADF-STEM images were acquired using a Fischione detector. The EELS spectra were acquired using a Gatan Enfinium ER 977 spectrometer equipped with DualEELS. Core-loss and low-loss spectra were acquired quasi-simultaneously over different regions of the specimen, using a 2 nm pixel size and a dispersion of 1 eV per channel. The dwell time was 0.2 s for core-loss spectra and 10 μs for low-loss spectra. Convergence and collection angles were 8.5 and 34 mrad, respectively. The elemental maps were obtained by weighted PCA and ICA.20 The quantification by curve fitting of the ICA results was performed using Hartree–Slater cross sections. All the EELS analysis was performed using the open source software package HyperSpy.21 SEM images were acquired using the in-lens detector in a LEO 1550 system. The acceleration voltage was set at 10 kV. This work was supported by the EPSRC [Grant Nos. EP/M005143/1, EP/J017361/1, and EP/G037221/1]. G.L. thanks Gates Cambridge Trust for funding.

Drawing conclusions about the influence of the components and curing conditions on the mechanical properties of the subsequently formed insoluble networks is challenging. Therefore, an in situ observation of chemical and mechanical characteristics during the photopolymerization reaction is desired. By coupling of an infrared spectrometer with a photorheometer, a broad spectrum of different photopolymerizable formulations can be analyzed during the curing reaction. The rheological information (i.e., time to gelation, final modulus, shrinkage force) can be derived from a parallel plate rheometer equipped with a UV- and IR-translucent window (glass for NIR and CaF2 window for MIR). Chemical information (i.e., conversion at the gel point and final conversion) is gained by monitoring the decrease of the corresponding IR-peak for the reactive monomer unit (e.g., C═C double bond peak for (meth)acrylates, H-S thiol and C═C double bond peak in thiol-ene systems, C-O epoxy peak for epoxy resins). Depending on the relative concentration of reactive functional groups in the sample volume and the intensity of the IR signal, the conversion can be monitored in the near-infrared region (e.g., acrylate double bonds, epoxy groups) or the MIR region (e.g., thiol signal). Moreover, an integrated Peltier element and external heating hood enable the characterization of photopolymerization reactions at elevated temperatures, which also widens the window of application to resins that are waxy or solid at ambient conditions. By switching from water to heavy water, the chemical conversion during photopolymerization of hydrogel precursor formulations can also be examined. Moreover, this device could also represent an analytical tool for a variety of thermally and redox initiated systems.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

A key advantage is that the inherent microporosity of these scaffolds provides cells with a more permissive environment than conventional nanoporous hydrogels. Here, norbornene-bearing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based microgels are assembled into 3D cell-instructive scaffolds using a PEG-dithiol linker and thiol-ene click photopolymerization. The bulk modulus of these materials depends primarily on the crosslink density of the microgel building blocks. However, the linker and initiator concentrations used during assembly have significant effects on cell spreading and proliferation when human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are incorporated in the scaffolds.

Polyisocyanide is well known for its distinctive rodlike helical structure and various applications in chiral recognition, enantiomer separation, circularly polarized luminescence, liquid crystallization, and other fields. Although various methods and catalysts for isocyanide polymerization have been reported, the precise synthesis of helical polyisocyanides with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity, and high tacticity remains a formidable challenge. Owing to a limited synthesis strategy, the controlled synthesis of topological polyisocyanides has barely been realized. This Accounts highlights our recent endeavors to explore novel catalysts for the living polymerization of isocyanides. Fortunately, we discovered that alkyne-Pd(II) catalysts could initiate the living polymerization of isocyanides, resulting in helical polyisocyanides with controlled structures, high tacticity, and tunable compositions. These catalysts are applicable to various isocyanide monomers, including alkyl isocyanides, aryl isocyanides, and diisocyanobenzene derivatives. Incorporating chiral bidentate phosphine ligands onto alkyne-Pd(II) complexes formed chiral Pd(II) catalysts, which promoted the asymmetric living polymerization of achiral isocyanide, yielding single left- and right-handed helices with highly optical activities.Using alkyne-Pd(II) catalysts, various topological polyisocyanides have been facilely prepared, including hybrid block copolymers, bottlebrush polymers, core cross-linked star polymers, and organic/inorganic nanoparticles. For instance, various hybrid block polyisocyanides were easily produced by coupling alkyne-Pd(II)-catalyzed living isocyanide polymerization with controlled radical polymerization and ring-opening polymerization (ROP). Combining the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene with Pd(II)-catalyzed isocyanide polymerization, bottlebrush polyisocyanides and core cross-linked star polymers were easily prepared. Pd(II)-catalyzed living polymerization of poly(lactic acid)s with isocyanide termini resulted in densely grafted bottlebrush polyisocyanides with closely packed side chains. Moreover, the surface-initiated living polymerization of isocyanides produced a family of polyisocyanide-grafted organic/inorganic hybrid nanoparticles using nanoparticles with alkyne-Pd(II) catalysts anchored on the surfaces. Surprisingly, the nanoparticles and star polymers with helical polyisocyanide arms performed exceptionally well in terms of chiral recognition and resolution. Incorporated organocatalysts such as proline and prolinol units onto the pendants of optically active helical polyisocyanides, a family of polymer-based chiral organocatalysts, were generated, which showed significantly improved stereoselectivity for the asymmetric Aldol reaction and Michael addition and can be easily recycled.Using a chiral alkyne-Pd(II) catalyst, single-handed helical polyisocyanides bearing naphthalene and pyrene probes were produced from achiral isocyanide monomers. These polymers showed excellent self-sorting properties as revealed using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) investigation and were self-assembled into two-dimensional (2D) smectic nanostructures driven by both helicity and chain length. Incorporating helical poly(phenyl isocyanide) (PPI) onto semiconducting poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) induced the asymmetric assembly of the resulting P3HT-b-PPI copolymers into single-handed cylindrical micelles with controlled dimensions and tunable photoluminescence.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

Most commonly, thermo and pH-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm) microgels can be fabricated by precipitation polymerization in the presence of the co-monomer acrylic acid (AAc). Traditionally pNIPAm microgels are synthesized in the presence of a crosslinking agent, such as N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), however, microgels can also be synthesized under 'crosslinker free' conditions. The resulting particles have extremely low (<0.5%), core-localized crosslinking resulting from rare chain transfer reactions. AFM nanoindentation of these ultralow crosslinked (ULC) particles indicate that they are soft relative to crosslinked microgels, with a Young's modulus of ∼10 kPa. Furthermore, ULC microgels are highly deformable as indicated by a high degree of spreading on glass surfaces and the ability to translocate through nanopores significantly smaller than the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles. The size and charge of ULCs can be easily modulated by altering reaction conditions, such as temperature, monomer, surfactant and initiator concentrations, and through the addition of co-monomers. Microgels based on the widely utilized, biocompatible polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) can also be synthesized under crosslinker free conditions. Due to their softness and deformability, ULC microgels are a unique base material for a wide variety of biomedical applications including biomaterials for drug delivery and regenerative medicine.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

Here we propose a NIR light free-radical photoinitiator (PI) fabricated by incorporating oxime-ester coumarin functionality on the surface of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The coumarin groups of PI absorb the light emitted from the UCNP core, whereas the oxime ester groups undergo cleavage to form radicals. Upon irradiation at 980 nm, the mobile radicals, formed in a manner similar to that of dandelion seed release, initiate both free-radical and thiol-ene photopolymerizations. The superior efficiency of dandelion-like PIs assisted photopolymerizations can be attributed to the reduction of energy loss and increased local PI concentration due to Förster resonance energy transfer process and confinement effect, respectively. Moreover, the proposed PI system can initiate polymerization under low-power NIR laser and reduces the thermal side effects. The possibility of its potential use in deep curing applications was also demonstrated.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

This paper reports a facile one-pot strategy to immobilize the biocompatible and fluorescent CDs (∼6 nm) into the glucose-imprinted poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-acrylamide-vinylphenylboronic acid) [poly(NIPAM-AAm-VPBA)] copolymer microgels for continuous optical glucose detection. The CDs designed with surface hydroxyl/carboxyl groups can form complexes with the AAm comonomers via hydrogen bonds and, thus, can be easily immobilized into the gel network during the polymerization reaction. The resultant glucose-imprinted hybrid microgels can reversibly swell and shrink in response to the variation of surrounding glucose concentration and correspondingly quench and recover the fluorescence signals of the embedded CDs, converting biochemical signals to optical signals. The highly imprinted hybrid microgels demonstrate much higher sensitivity and selectivity for glucose detection than the nonimprinted hybrid microgels over a clinically relevant range of 0-30 mM at physiological pH and benefited from the synergistic effects of the glucose molecular contour and the geometrical constraint of the binding sites dictated by the glucose imprinting process. The highly stable immobilization of CDs in the gel networks provides the hybrid microgels with excellent optical signal reproducibility after five repeated cycles of addition and dialysis removal of glucose in the bathing medium. In addition, the hybrid microgels show no effect on the cell viability in the tested concentration range of 25-100 μg/mL. The glucose-imprinted poly(NIPAM-AAm-VPBA)-CDs hybrid microgels demonstrate a great promise for a new glucose sensor that can continuously monitor glucose level change.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

In this study, we designed aqueous dispersions of biocompatible whey-protein microgel particles (WPM) (10-80 vol %) cross-linked via disulfide bonding and focused on understanding their rheological, structural and biotribological properties (smooth polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) contacts, Ra < 50 nm, ball-on-disk set up). The WPM particles (Dh = 380 nm) displayed shear-thinning behavior and good lubricating performance in the plateau boundary as well as the mixed lubrication regimes. The WPM particles facilitated lubrication between bare hydrophobic PDMS surfaces (water contact angle 108°), leading to a 10-fold reduction in boundary friction force with increased volume fraction (ϕ ≥ 65%), largely attributed to the close packing-mediated layer of particles between the asperity contacts acting as \"true surface-separators\", hydrophobic moieties of WPM binding to the nonpolar surfaces, and particles employing a rolling mechanism analogous to \"ball bearings\", the latter supported by negligible change in size and microstructure of the WPM particles after tribology. An ultralow boundary friction coefficient, μ ≤ 0.03 was achieved using WPM between O2 plasma-treated hydrophilic PDMS contacts coated with bovine submaxillary mucin (water contact angle 47°), and electron micrographs revealed that the WPM particles spread effectively as a layer of particles even at low ϕ∼ 10%, forming a lubricating load-bearing film that prevented the two surfaces from true adhesive contact. However, above an optimum volume fraction, μ increased in HL+BSM surfaces due to the interpenetration of particles that possibly impeded effective rolling, explaining the slight increase in friction. These effects are reflected in the highly shear thinning nature of the WPM dispersions themselves plus the tendency for the apparent viscosity to fall as dispersions are forced to very high volume fractions. The present work demonstrates a novel approach for providing ultralow friction in soft polymeric surfaces using proteinaceous microgel particles that satisfy both load bearing and kinematic requirements. These findings hold great potential for designing biocompatible particles for aqueous lubrication in numerous soft matter applications.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

We developed a pooled high-throughput screen to identify archaerhodopsin mutants with enhanced photoactivation. After screening ~10 5 cells, we identified a novel GEVI, NovArch, whose one-photon near-infrared fluorescence is reversibly enhanced by weak one-photon blue or two-photon near-infrared excitation. Because the photoactivation leads to fluorescent signals catalytically rather than stoichiometrically, high fluorescence signals, optical sectioning, and high time resolution are achieved simultaneously at modest blue or two-photon laser power. We demonstrate applications of the combined molecular and optical tools to optical mapping of membrane voltage in distal dendrites in acute mouse brain slices and in spontaneously active neurons in vivo.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

As in many other photochemical scenarios, the structural and energetic factors play relevant roles in determining the rates and efficiencies of PET and its competitive photodeactivation processes. Particularly, in the field of fluorescent sensors and switches, intramolecular PET is believed (in many cases without compelling experimental proof) to be responsible of the quench of fluorescence. There is an increasing experimental interest in fluorophore's molecular design and on achieving optimal excitation/emission spectra, excitation coefficients, and fluorescence quantum yields (importantly for bioimaging purposes), but less efforts are devoted to fundamental mechanistic studies. In this Account, I revise the origins of the fluorescence quenching in some of these systems with state-of-the-art quantum chemical tools. These studies go beyond the common strategy of analyzing frontier orbital energy diagrams and performing PET thermodynamics calculations. Instead, the potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the lowest-lying excited states are explored with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations and the radiative and nonradiative decay rates from the involved excited states are computed from first-principles using a thermal vibration correlation function formalism. With such a strategy, this work reveals the real origins of the fluorescence quenching, herein entitled as dark-state quenching. Dark states (those that do not absorb or emit light) are often elusive to experiments and thus, computational investigations can provide novel insights into the actual photodeactivation mechanisms. The success of the dark-state quenching mechanism is demonstrated for a wide variety of fluorescent probes, including proton, cation and anion targets. Furthermore, this mechanism provides a general picture of the fluorescence quenching which englobes intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT), ratiometric quenching, and those radiationless mechanisms believed to be originated by PET. Finally, this Account provides for the first time a computational protocol to quantitatively estimate this phenomenon and provides the ingredients for the optimal design of fluorescent probes from first principles.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

Here, a plant-inspired adhesive hydrogel has been developed based on Ag-Lignin nanoparticles (NPs)triggered dynamic redox catechol chemistry. Ag-Lignin NPs construct the dynamic catechol redox system, which creates long-lasting reductive-oxidative environment inner hydrogel networks. This redox system, generating catechol groups continuously, endows the hydrogel with long-term and repeatable adhesiveness. Furthermore, Ag-Lignin NPs generate free radicals and trigger self-gelation of the hydrogel under ambient environment. This hydrogel presents high toughness for the existence of covalent and non-covalent interaction in the hydrogel networks. The hydrogel also possesses good cell affinity and high antibacterial activity due to the catechol groups and bactericidal ability of Ag-Lignin NPs. This study proposes a strategy to design tough and adhesive hydrogels based on dynamic plant catechol chemistry.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

Responsive micro- and nanogels are particularly interesting because the small length scale enables very fast response times. Chemical cross-links provide topological constraints and define the three-dimensional structure of the microgels, whereas their porous structure permits fast mass transfer, enabling very rapid structural adaption of the microgel to the environment. The change of microgel structure involves a unique transition from a flexible, swollen finite-size macromolecular network, characterized by a fuzzy surface, to a colloidal particle with homogeneous density and a sharp surface. In this contribution, we determine, for the first time, the structural evolution during the microgel-to-particle transition. Time-resolved small-angle x-ray scattering experiments and computer simulations unambiguously reveal a two-stage process: In a first, very fast process, collapsed clusters form at the periphery, leading to an intermediate, hollowish core-shell structure that slowly transforms to a globule. This structural evolution is independent of the type of stimulus and thus applies to instantaneous transitions as in a temperature jump or to slower stimuli that rely on the uptake of active molecules from and/or exchange with the environment. The fast transitions of size and shape provide unique opportunities for various applications as, for example, in uptake and release, catalysis, or sensing.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

Hydrogel-based actuators that can imitate the capabilities of leptocephali will enable new applications in diverse fields. However, existing hydrogel actuators, mostly osmotic-driven, are intrinsically low-speed and/or low-force; and their camouflage capabilities have not been explored. Here we show that hydraulic actuations of hydrogels with designed structures and properties can give soft actuators and robots that are high-speed, high-force, and optically and sonically camouflaged in water. The hydrogel actuators and robots can maintain their robustness and functionality over multiple cycles of actuations, owing to the anti-fatigue property of the hydrogel under moderate stresses. We further demonstrate that the agile and transparent hydrogel actuators and robots perform extraordinary functions including swimming, kicking rubber-balls and even catching a live fish in water.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

The transition metal-based photocatalysts commonly employed in photoredox catalysis absorb efficiently in the visible spectrum, unlike most organic substrates, allowing for orthogonal excitation. The subsequent excited states are both more reducing and more oxidizing than the ground state catalyst and are competitive with some of the more powerful single-electron oxidants or reductants available to organic chemists yet are simply accessed via irradiation. The benefits of this strategy have proven particularly useful in radical chemistry, a field that traditionally employs rather toxic and hazardous reagents to generate the desired intermediates.In this Account, we discuss our efforts to leverage visible light photoredox catalysis in radical-based bond-forming and bond-cleaving events for which few, if any, environmentally benign alternatives exist. Mechanistic investigations have driven our contributions in this field, for both facilitating desired transformations and offering new, unexpected opportunities. In fact, our total synthesis of (+)-gliocladin C was only possible upon elucidating the propensity for various trialkylamine additives to elicit a dual behavior as both a reductive quencher and a H-atom donor. Importantly, while natural product synthesis was central to our initial motivations to explore these photochemical processes, we have since demonstrated applicability within other subfields of chemistry, and our evaluation of flow technologies demonstrates the potential to translate these results from the bench to pilot scale.Our forays into photoredox catalysis began with fundamental methodology, providing a tin-free reductive dehalogenation that exchanged the gamut of hazardous reagents previously employed for such a transformation for visible light-mediated, ambient temperature conditions. Evolving from this work, a new avenue toward atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) chemistry was developed, enabling dual functionalization of both double and triple bonds. Importantly, we have also expanded our portfolio to target clinically relevant scaffolds. Photoredox catalysis proved effective in generating high value fluorinated alkyl radicals through the use of abundantly available starting materials, providing access to libraries of trifluoromethylated (hetero)arenes as well as intriguing gem-difluoro benzyl motifs via a novel photochemical radical Smiles rearrangement. Finally, we discuss a photochemical strategy toward sustainable lignin processing through selective C–O bond cleavage methodology. The collection of these efforts is meant to highlight the potential for visible light-mediated radical chemistry to impact a variety of industrial sectors.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

However, the utility of existing GEVIs has been limited by the brightness and photostability of fluorescent proteins and rhodopsins. We engineered a GEVI, called Voltron, that uses bright and photostable synthetic dyes instead of protein-based fluorophores, thereby extending the number of neurons imaged simultaneously in vivo by a factor of 10 and enabling imaging for significantly longer durations relative to existing GEVIs. We used Voltron for in vivo voltage imaging in mice, zebrafish, and fruit flies. In the mouse cortex, Voltron allowed single-trial recording of spikes and subthreshold voltage signals from dozens of neurons simultaneously over a 15-minute period of continuous imaging. In larval zebrafish, Voltron enabled the precise correlation of spike timing with behavior.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

These materials are also notable for their unusual phase behavior often displaying easily accessible phase transitions. In this work, time-resolved X-ray diffraction, performed on perovskite cesium lead bromide nanocrystals, maps the lattice response to controlled excitation fluence. These nanocrystals undergo a reversible, photoinduced orthorhombic-to-cubic phase transition which is discernible at fluences greater than 0.34 mJ cm-2 through the loss of orthorhombic features and shifting of high-symmetry peaks. This transition recovers on the timescale of 510 ± 100 ps. A reversible crystalline-to-amorphous transition, observable through loss of Bragg diffraction intensity, occurs at higher fluences (greater than 2.5 mJ cm-2). These results demonstrate that light-driven phase transitions occur in perovskite materials, which will impact optoelectronic applications and enable the manipulation of non-equilibrium phase characteristics of the broad perovskite material class.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}

Although considerable advances have recently been achieved in radical-involved catalytic asymmetric C–N bond formation, there has been little progress in the corresponding C–O bond-forming processes. Here, we describe a photoinduced copper-catalyzed cross-coupling of readily available oxime esters and 1,3-dienes to generate diversely substituted allylic esters with high regio- and enantioselectivity (>75 examples; up to 95% ee). The reaction proceeds at room temperature under excitation by purple light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and features the use of a single, earth-abundant copper-based chiral catalyst as both the photoredox catalyst for radical generation and the source of asymmetric induction in C–O coupling. Combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) computational studies suggest the formation of π-allylcopper complexes from redox-active oxime esters as bifunctional reagents and 1,3-dienes through a radical–polar crossover process.\n\nOUTPUT JSON SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"id\": \"string\",\n  \"relevance_label\": \"relevant|maybe|irrelevant\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"rationale\": \"string\",\n  \"signals\": {\n    \"workflow_described\": false,\n    \"multi_objective\": false,\n    \"optimization_language\": false,\n    \"automation_cue\": false,\n    \"device_centric\": false,\n    \"review_like\": false\n  },\n  \"failure_reasons\": []\n}\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n- relevant: actionable workflow + domain-specific + not device-centric.\n- maybe: partial specificity OR weak workflow detail OR ambiguous focus.\n- irrelevant: lacks actionable workflow OR is review/device-only/theoretical hype.\n- workflow_described = true if explicit procedural or iterative steps.\n- multi_objective = true if >=2 distinct goals (e.g., conversion + stability).\n- optimization_language = true if optimize / maximize / improve / balance / minimize verbs appear.\n- automation_cue = true if automated / iterative / closed-loop / platform / high-throughput cues exist.\n- device_centric = true if primary emphasis is hardware performance metrics without workflow substance.\n- review_like = true if survey style (broad enumerations, 'this review').\n- failure_reasons (only if label != relevant) choose from: [\"too_device_specific\",\"no_workflow\",\"review_style\",\"generic_hype\",\"insufficient_specificity\",\"theoretical_only\"]\n- Provide a concise evidence-based rationale citing concrete phrases.\nReturn ONLY the JSON.\n"}
