# Slack Error Handling Fix

## Problem
The Slack agent was causing workflow crashes when network connectivity issues occurred. The specific error was:
```
Error: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='hooks.slack.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /services/T012M3T3U01/B0942T6526R/rbJXY78M6bufQwcs9InL7THn (Caused by NameResolutionError(...): Failed to resolve 'hooks.slack.com' ([Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed))
```

This would terminate the entire workflow when Slack connectivity was lost.

## Solution
Updated `slack_agent.py` with comprehensive error handling:

### 1. Enhanced `send_slack_message()` Function
- Added try/catch for all network-related exceptions
- Specific handling for:
  - `ConnectionError` and `NameResolutionError` (network connectivity)
  - `Timeout` (slow connections)  
  - `RequestException` (general request failures)
  - General `Exception` (unexpected errors)
- Added 10-second timeout to prevent hanging
- All errors log properly and return `False` instead of crashing
- Workflows continue running even when Slack fails

### 2. Enhanced `upload_and_post_file()` Function  
- Same robust error handling for file uploads
- Network errors don't crash file upload workflows

### 3. New Helper Functions
- `test_slack_connectivity()` - Quick connectivity check
- `safe_send_slack_message()` - Extra-safe wrapper with optional silent mode

### 4. Existing Error Handling
The `North_Safe.py` file already had good error handling in `pause_after_error()`:
```python
try:
    slack_agent.send_slack_message(err_message)
except Exception as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Failed to send Slack message: {e}")
```

## Usage Recommendations

### For New Code
Use the safe wrapper for maximum protection:
```python
slack_agent.safe_send_slack_message("Workflow started!", silent_fail=False)
```

### For Existing Code
No changes needed! The enhanced `send_slack_message()` function now handles all errors gracefully. All existing workflow calls like:
```python
slack_agent.send_slack_message("Workflow completed!")
```
Will continue to work and won't crash workflows anymore.

## Testing
Run `test_slack_resilience.py` to verify error handling works correctly with or without network connectivity.

## Key Benefits
- ✅ Workflows continue running even with complete network outages
- ✅ Proper error logging for debugging connectivity issues  
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing workflow code
- ✅ Clear user feedback when Slack fails ("continuing workflow")
- ✅ Return values allow workflows to adapt behavior if needed
