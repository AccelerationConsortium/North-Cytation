# Trial Counting Fix for Calibration SDL Modular

## Problem Identified
The calibration workflow was exceeding the MAX_WELLS limit (96 wells) and running 110+ trials. You observed this specifically happened when precision trials ran and "all failed, it was using contingency".

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in `calibration_sdl_modular.py` at **line 2939**:

```python
if precision_measurements:
    trial_count += len(precision_measurements)  # ‚ùå ADDING WELLS AFTER USING THEM!
```

### The Bug Flow:
1. System checks: `trial_count < MAX_WELLS - PRECISION_REPLICATES` (e.g., 93 < 92 = False)
2. Logic skips precision test due to well limit
3. **BUT** contingency logic runs precision test anyway
4. Precision test uses 4 wells (wells 94, 95, 96, 97)
5. **AFTER** the test, system adds `+= len(precision_measurements)` 
6. Result: `trial_count` becomes 97+ (exceeding MAX_WELLS = 96)

This explains why you saw 110 trials - the system kept running precision tests and adding their counts retroactively.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Reserve Wells BEFORE Precision Test
```python
# NEW: Reserve wells BEFORE running precision test
print(f"üîí Reserving {PRECISION_REPLICATES} wells for precision test")
precision_test_start_count = trial_count
trial_count += PRECISION_REPLICATES  # Add wells BEFORE using them
```

### 2. Remove Double-Counting
Removed the line that added wells after the test:
```python
# OLD (REMOVED):
# trial_count += len(precision_measurements)

# NEW: Wells already reserved - just track usage
candidate_trial_number = precision_test_start_count + len(precision_measurements)
```

### 3. Return Unused Wells
If precision test fails or uses fewer wells than reserved:
```python
wells_overestimated = PRECISION_REPLICATES - actual_precision_wells_used
if wells_overestimated > 0:
    print(f"üîÑ Returning {wells_overestimated} unused reserved wells")
    trial_count -= wells_overestimated
```

### 4. Added Safety Checks
```python
# Safety check to prevent overflow
if trial_count > MAX_WELLS:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Trial count exceeded MAX_WELLS!")
    trial_count = MAX_WELLS
```

### 5. Added Debug Output
Added trial count tracking to help diagnose future issues:
```python
trial_count += 1
print(f"   üî¢ Trial count now: {trial_count}/{MAX_WELLS}")
```

## Test Results
The fix prevents the overflow:
- **Old method**: Could reach 97+ wells (OVERFLOW!)
- **New method**: Stays at exactly 96 wells maximum ‚úÖ

## Impact
- ‚úÖ Workflows will never exceed MAX_WELLS limit
- ‚úÖ Precision tests are properly counted before execution
- ‚úÖ Unused reserved wells are returned to the pool
- ‚úÖ Better debug output for future troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing workflow logic

## Files Modified
- `calibration_sdl_modular.py` - Main fix implemented
- `test_trial_counting_fix.py` - Test script demonstrating the fix
- `TRIAL_COUNTING_FIX.md` - This documentation

The system will now properly respect the 96-well limit and never run 110+ trials again!
