1,20.0,25.0,12.0,18.0,5.0,0.02,0.03,0.01,high,"Aspirate speed of 20 uL/s and dispense speed of 25 uL/s are mid‑range values that strike a balance between reducing shear (which can degrade precision) and maintaining a reasonable throughput. The mid‑range wait times (12 s aspirate, 18 s dispense) allow the viscous glycerol to settle and relieve surface tension without excessive delay. A retract speed of 5 uL/s is moderate enough to avoid dragging air bubbles but not so slow as to add noise. The blowout volume (0.02 mL) and post‑aspirate air volume (0.03 mL) are sufficient to clear the tip of residual liquid while limiting excess loss. A small overaspirate of 0.01 mL compensates for any aspiration error due to viscosity, improving accuracy.",≈10–12 % reduction in volume deviation and ≈8 % improvement in repeatability compared to baseline fast‑speed settings.
2,28.0,15.0,20.0,10.0,7.0,0.015,0.025,0.02,medium,"In this set, the aspirate speed is relatively high (28 uL/s) which actually corresponds to a slower physical aspirate due to the inverse scaling; this gives the viscous liquid more time to be drawn in smoothly, reducing pulsation. The dispense speed is low (15 uL/s), i.e., fast physically, minimizing the chance of splashing. Longer aspirate wait (20 s) gives extra settling time, whereas a shorter dispense wait (10 s) speeds up the second step without compromising accuracy because dispensing is less sensitive to surface tension for glycerol. Retract speed is moderate (7 uL/s). The blowout volume is slightly lower to avoid unnecessary loss, while post‑asp air volume is balanced. Overaspirate is higher (0.02 mL) to compensate for potential under‑aspiration at the slower aspirate step.",≈6–8 % decrease in drift over 100 cycles; improved precision in low‑volume dispensing.
3,12.0,30.0,8.0,25.0,2.0,0.05,0.01,0.005,medium,"A lower aspirate speed (12 uL/s, high physical speed) allows quick intake but the higher inverse value means a slower aspirate, giving the viscous liquid time to fill the tip without shear. Dispense speed is high (30 uL/s, slow physically) to ensure gentle ejection and reduce turbulence. Aspirate wait is short (8 s) because the quick aspirate already mitigates settling, while dispense wait is long (25 s) to allow the viscous liquid to flow out completely. Retract speed is very low (2 uL/s) to avoid pulling air back. A larger blowout volume ensures complete tip clearance, and a minimal post‑aspirate air volume keeps waste low. The minimal overaspirate (0.005 mL) keeps volume tight.","≈5 % reduction in dispensing error, with a slight increase in overall throughput due to balanced wait times."
4,24.0,22.0,15.0,15.0,9.0,0.012,0.035,0.015,high,"Both speeds are in the middle of the range (24 uL/s aspirate, 22 uL/s dispense) to keep the operation balanced, which is ideal for medium‑viscosity liquids. Equal wait times (15 s) provide symmetric settling, minimizing potential bias between aspirate and dispense. Retract speed of 9 uL/s is moderately slow to prevent air entrapment while not over‑slowing. The blowout volume is small to reduce waste, but the higher post‑asp air volume (0.035 mL) ensures any residual viscous liquid is pushed out, improving precision. Overaspirate of 0.015 mL helps correct for the small under‑aspiration typical with glycerol at these speeds.",≈12 % lower variance across replicates; improved repeatability in multi‑step protocols.
5,27.0,10.0,18.0,12.0,4.5,0.025,0.02,0.02,medium,"Aspirate speed is high (27 uL/s, slow physically) to reduce shear; dispense speed is low (10 uL/s, fast physically) to speed up the ejection phase while still handling viscosity. Longer aspirate wait (18 s) allows full tip fill; shorter dispense wait (12 s) ensures timely dispensing. Retract speed is low (4.5 uL/s) to avoid pulling air. Blowout volume is moderate to clear the tip after dispensing. The post‑asp air volume balances between minimizing waste and ensuring clearance. Overaspirate of 0.02 mL helps offset the slower aspirate step.","≈7–9 % improvement in accuracy for larger volumes, maintaining acceptable throughput."
