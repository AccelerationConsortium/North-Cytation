# Minimal hardware config for volume calibration
# Intent: only the indispensable pieces required to bridge optimization params -> measured volumes.
# Hardware layer (provided externally) is responsible for communications & execution.

system: north_cytation

# Name of a callable or adapter class (import-resolvable) that will perform the work
# Signature expectation (conceptual):
#   run_pipetting(params: dict, target_volume_mL: float, replicates: int, liquid: str) -> list[float]
handler: calibration_hardware.handle_pipetting

measurement:
  method: mass          # mass | plate_reader (future extension)

density:
  override_g_per_ml: null  # if set, bypass liquids.yaml density lookup

# Optional simple timing hints (adapter may ignore if unsupported)
hints:
  settle_delay_s: 0.5

# Everything else intentionally omitted until proven necessary.
