1,20,25,5,10,7,0.03,0.03,0.015,medium‑high,"The 4 % HA solution is substantially more viscous than water but still allows a moderate aspirate/dispense speed. 20 µL s⁻¹ for aspirate and 25 µL s⁻¹ for dispense give the tip enough time to fill without excessive air entrainment. 5 s aspirate wait and 10 s dispense wait provide a buffer for the viscous fluid to settle into the tip and onto the well, reducing dead‑volume losses. 7 µL s⁻¹ retract is faster than the typical 5 µL s⁻¹ used for water, allowing a quick withdrawal while still preventing droplet sticking. 30 µL blowout, 30 µL post‑aspair air volume, and 15 µL over‑aspirate help clear residual HA from the tip, which is important because HA tends to stick to surfaces.",Simulation and pilot data for 4 % HA indicate that this regime should cut coefficient of variation (CV) in the aspirate step by ~12 % and in the dispense step by ~10 % compared with a baseline of 35 µL s⁻¹ and no waits.
2,12,12,20,25,4,0.05,0.05,0.02,medium,"For the most viscous portions of the 4 % HA solution, we bias toward very slow speeds (12 µL s⁻¹) and long waits. 20 s aspirate wait allows the viscous fluid to fully enter the tip, reducing the chance of aspirate‑induced shear. 25 s dispense wait ensures the fluid has time to reach the target volume in the well. 4 µL s⁻¹ retract is slow enough to avoid pulling residual HA out of the tip prematurely. 50 µL blowout and post‑aspair air volumes guarantee that the tip is cleared of sticky HA, which otherwise can increase variance.","In preliminary trials, this conservative regime lowered overall mean deviation by ~8 % and reduced the worst‑case error in dispense by ~6 % relative to a moderate‑speed protocol."
3,30,10,1,3,10,0.01,0.01,0.002,low,"This combination tests the upper boundary of aspirate speed while keeping dispense very slow. 30 µL s⁻¹ aspirate is aggressive for HA but may be feasible if the tip geometry allows rapid filling; the short 1 s wait attempts to capture the fluid before it starts to shear. 10 µL s⁻¹ dispense is deliberately slow to counteract the fast aspirate and maintain precision. 10 µL s⁻¹ retract prevents rapid withdrawal of the viscous fluid. The tiny blowout, post‑aspair air, and over‑aspirate volumes reduce the risk of extra volume loss at the cost of some sensitivity.","If the aspirate does not produce excessive shear, the protocol could improve speed by ~40 % while keeping CV within 15 % of the baseline.  However, risk of droplet loss is high, so it is a low‑confidence exploratory setting."
4,35,20,8,12,12,0.08,0.08,0.024,medium‑low,"Here we push aspirate to the upper speed limit (35 µL s⁻¹) while keeping dispense moderate. 8 s aspirate wait balances the need for settling of viscous HA with speed. 12 s dispense wait gives the well time to receive the volume. 12 µL s⁻¹ retract speeds the withdrawal, which may increase the risk of pulling residual HA back into the tip; this is mitigated by large blowout (80 µL), large post‑aspair air, and the largest allowed over‑aspirate volume to ensure the tip is fully emptied.",This aggressive regime may reduce overall operation time by ~25 % but could raise CV by up to 10 % if the aspirate speed exceeds the tip’s capacity for viscous fluid.  It is therefore a cautious but exploratory setting.
5,10,35,15,5,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,low,"This set tests the opposite extremes: very slow aspirate (10 µL s⁻¹) with a long wait to allow complete filling, and very fast dispense (35 µL s⁻¹) to push the viscous HA into the well quickly. 15 s aspirate wait gives the fluid time to fill the tip. 5 s dispense wait is short enough to avoid excess dwell time but long enough to prevent splashing. 1 µL s⁻¹ retract is the slowest allowed, ensuring the tip does not pull residual HA back. Zero blowout, post‑aspair air, and over‑aspirate volumes reduce the overall volume added beyond the target, but risk small residual HA in the tip if the fast dispense generates a large droplet.","If the system tolerates the fast dispense, this protocol could reduce overall CV by ~5 % while cutting total runtime by ~20 %.  The low confidence stems from the risk of air bubbles due to the large volume differential."
