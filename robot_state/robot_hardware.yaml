# North Robot hardware configuration
# Hardware axis and pneumatic mappings for both North_Robot and North_Track systems

# North Robot motion axes (C9 controller)
# Based on actual hardware mapping: [gripper, elbow, shoulder, z-axis]
robot_axes:
  gripper_axis: 0   # Gripper rotation/movement axis
  elbow_axis: 1     # Elbow joint axis  
  shoulder_axis: 2  # Shoulder joint axis
  z_axis: 3         # Z-axis for vertical movement
  
# Track system axes (separate from robot axes)
track_axes:
  x_axis: 7  # Track X-axis (horizontal movement)
  z_axis: 6  # Track Z-axis (vertical movement)

# Pneumatic outputs for track gripper
track_pneumatics:
  gripper_open: 4   # Pneumatic output for opening track gripper
  gripper_close: 5  # Pneumatic output for closing track gripper

# Movement speeds (mm/s or units/s)
# ORIGINAL VALUES (commented for restoration): default_robot: 20, fast_approach: 30, standard_xy: 15, precise_movement: 5, retract: 5
movement_speeds:
  default_robot: 20       # Default velocity for robot initialization (was: 20)
  fast_approach: 30       # Fast approach movements (was: 30)
  standard_xy: 15         # Standard XY positioning speed (was: 15)  
  precise_movement: 5    # Precise/slow movements (unchanged)
  retract: 5            # Speed when retracting pipet from liquid (unchanged)
