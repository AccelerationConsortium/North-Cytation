# North Robot hardware configuration
# Hardware axis and pneumatic mappings for both North_Robot and North_Track systems

# North Robot motion axes (C9 controller)
# Based on actual hardware mapping: [gripper, elbow, shoulder, z-axis]
robot_axes:
  gripper_axis: 0   # Gripper rotation/movement axis
  elbow_axis: 1     # Elbow joint axis  
  shoulder_axis: 2  # Shoulder joint axis
  z_axis: 3         # Z-axis for vertical movement
  
# Track system axes (separate from robot axes)
track_axes:
  x_axis: 7  # Track X-axis (horizontal movement)
  z_axis: 6  # Track Z-axis (vertical movement)

# Pneumatic outputs for track gripper
track_pneumatics:
  gripper_open: 4   # Pneumatic output for opening track gripper
  gripper_close: 5  # Pneumatic output for closing track gripper

# Movement speeds (mm/s or units/s)
movement_speeds:
  default_robot: 20      # Default velocity for robot initialization
  fast_approach: 30      # Fast approach movements (pipet removal, general fast moves)
  standard_xy: 15        # Standard XY positioning speed (goto_xy_safe)
  precise_movement: 5    # Precise/slow movements (pipet pickup, careful positioning)
  retract: 5            # Speed when retracting pipet from liquid

# Physical constants
physical_constants:
  safe_height_z: 292    # Safe height for general robot movements
