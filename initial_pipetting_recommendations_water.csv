1,10.0,12.0,1.0,1.5,5.0,0.08,0.01,0.02,high,"The lowest aspirate and dispense speeds minimize fluid inertial spikes, essential for low‑viscosity water. Short wait times reduce bubble trapping, while a moderate retract speed (5 uL/s) balances tip clearance and avoids tip bounce. A generous blowout volume (0.08 mL) ensures residual liquid is expelled, and the tiny post‑aspiratory air volume (0.01 mL) keeps dead‑volume minimal. These settings follow standard best practices for high‑accuracy liquid handling of water.","Anticipated 15 % reduction in coefficient of variation compared to a generic 20 uL/s program, with accuracy improved to within ±0.5 µL."
2,13.0,10.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,0.04,0.03,0.015,medium,"Mixing a slightly higher aspirate speed with a lower dispense speed probes the effect of asymmetric fluid dynamics. The 5‑second aspirate wait allows capillary forces to settle the drawn liquid, and the 4‑second dispense wait further eliminates air entrainment. A retract speed of 8 uL/s is fast enough to reduce tip adhesion but slow enough to prevent sudden tip ejection. Moderate blowout volume keeps residual liquid minimal while the larger air volume (0.03 mL) ensures a clean air‑liquid interface.",Expected ~12 % lower mean absolute error and 10 % lower variance relative to the high‑speed baseline.
3,11.0,15.0,0.5,0.7,2.0,0.09,0.0,0.025,medium‑low,"The very short waits target rapid throughput while relying on the high dispense speed to deliver water swiftly. A low retract speed (2 uL/s) maximizes tip clearance by giving the liquid more time to flow away, which is advantageous for very low viscosity fluids. The maximal blowout volume (0.09 mL) ensures almost all liquid is expelled, and the absence of post‑aspiratory air volume eliminates dead‑volume contribution. This configuration tests the limits of speed‑dependent accuracy.","Prediction: 8 % decrease in systematic bias and 7 % reduction in CV, but with a risk of increased tip retention if not monitored."
4,14.0,14.0,10.0,12.0,10.0,0.04,0.05,0.02,medium,"Symmetric speeds at a moderate pace provide a balanced hydrodynamic profile, reducing the risk of tip drag or bubble formation. Long wait times (10‑12 s) allow the system to fully settle, beneficial for avoiding oscillatory flow in the aspiration and dispensing channels. The retract speed (10 uL/s) ensures prompt tip retraction while avoiding tip bounce. A moderate air volume (0.05 mL) gives a buffer against residual liquid, while the blowout volume (0.04 mL) clears remaining liquid. This design is ideal for reproducible, high‑volume transfers.",Projected 10 % reduction in both mean error and variance compared to the fastest‑speed baseline.
5,12.0,18.0,8.0,5.0,12.0,0.03,0.04,0.008,low,"This configuration deliberately uses a higher dispense speed to investigate if accelerated delivery reduces overall cycle time without compromising accuracy. The aspirate speed remains moderate to maintain stability. The aspirate wait (8 s) is longer than the dispense wait (5 s) to compensate for the faster dispensing rate. Retract speed (12 uL/s) keeps tip clearance quick, and a small blowout volume (0.03 mL) reduces dead‑volume. The very low overaspirate volume (0.008 mL) helps test the limits of excess liquid management. This design explores the speed‑variance trade‑off but carries higher risk of bubble entrapment.",Potential 5 % faster cycle time with an estimated 9 % increase in CV if bubbles are not adequately removed.
