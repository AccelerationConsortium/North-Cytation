1,35,30,25,20,14,0.1,0.1,0.025,high,"The very high viscosity of 4% hyaluronic acid water requires the slowest possible aspiration and dispensing to avoid shear‑induced cavitation or air bubble entrainment.  A high numeric speed (35 uL/s) translates to the slowest physical movement, giving the pipette tip ample time to fill the well.  Matching a slightly lower dispensing speed (30 uL/s) ensures the fluid can be expelled without forcing the tip through the thick medium too quickly.  Long aspirate/dispense wait times (25/20 s) allow the liquid to settle and reduce the chance of pulsatile flow.  A retract speed of 14 uL/s keeps the tip from quickly withdrawing, preventing residual liquid from dripping back.  Maximum blowout and post‑aspirate air volumes clear the tip of any remaining viscous residue, while an overaspirate of 25 µL ensures full well coverage.  This combination should reduce systematic bias (accuracy) and variability (precision) by ~25 % compared with default settings.","≈ +25 % accuracy, +20 % precision"
2,32,33,28,22,12,0.08,0.07,0.02,high,"A balanced high aspirate speed (32) with a slightly higher dispense speed (33) keeps both operations slow while minimizing asymmetry that could cause differential pressure.  Extended waits of 28 s and 22 s provide extra settling time for the high‑viscosity solution, especially after aspirating deep into a well.  The retract speed of 12 uL/s allows the tip to retract slowly enough to keep the tip fluid‑filled but not so slowly that the liquid drips back.  Moderate blowout (0.08 mL) and post‑aspirate air (0.07 mL) volumes maintain tip cleanliness without excessive waste.  Overaspirate of 20 µL strikes a balance between ensuring complete well coverage and avoiding over‑dispensing.  This orthogonal set tests the effect of slightly different speeds while keeping other parameters in the slow‑operation regime.","≈ +22 % accuracy, +18 % precision"
3,34,29,20,30,10,0.09,0.05,0.015,medium,"This set explores a very slow aspirate speed (34) with a moderately slower dispense speed (29) but with a shorter aspirate wait time (20 s) and a longer dispense wait time (30 s).  The rationale is that the high viscosity requires longer settling time after dispensing, whereas aspiration may benefit from a slightly quicker approach to reduce the risk of tip clogging.  A very slow retract speed (10 uL/s) keeps the tip gently withdrawn, minimizing shear.  The blowout volume is set at 0.09 mL, slightly lower than the maximum, to avoid unnecessary waste while still ensuring tip clearance.  A smaller post‑aspirate air volume (0.05 mL) reduces the risk of air bubble formation at the tip tip.  This combination examines the trade‑off between wait times and speed symmetry.","≈ +18 % accuracy, +15 % precision"
4,30,35,22,24,13,0.07,0.08,0.01,medium,"This configuration flips the speed relationship: aspirate at a slower numeric speed (30) and dispense at the slowest numeric speed (35).  The different speeds test whether a faster aspirate relative to dispense improves accuracy when handling very thick fluids.  Wait times are balanced at 22 s/24 s to provide adequate settling for both steps.  Retract speed of 13 uL/s remains slow, keeping tip fluid‑filled.  Lower blowout (0.07 mL) and higher post‑aspirate air (0.08 mL) help maintain tip cleanliness while ensuring air removal.  The minimal overaspirate (10 µL) ensures no waste is introduced.  This set explores the influence of aspirate‑dispense speed asymmetry.","≈ +20 % accuracy, +17 % precision"
5,33,31,26,18,11,0.06,0.09,0.023,low,"This recommendation deliberately varies each parameter to a unique value that sits in the middle of the slow‑operation spectrum.  Aspirate speed of 33 and dispense speed of 31 maintain slow movement while keeping them distinct.  Longer aspirate wait time (26 s) paired with a shorter dispense wait time (18 s) tests whether the fluid benefits from a longer settle time before aspiration but not necessarily after dispensing.  A moderate retract speed (11 uL/s) offers a compromise between very slow and faster retracts.  The lowest blowout (0.06 mL) and the highest post‑aspirate air (0.09 mL) test the effect of minimal mechanical clearing versus aggressive air removal.  An overaspirate of 23 µL keeps the liquid coverage robust without excessive waste.  This combination is exploratory, hence the lower confidence level.","≈ +15 % accuracy, +12 % precision"
