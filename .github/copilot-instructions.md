# North Robotics Laboratory Automation System

## Architecture Overview

This is a self-driving laboratory (SDL) system integrating:
- **North Robot**: Liquid handling robot with pipetting and vial manipulation
- **North Track**: Automated wellplate transport system
- **Cytation 5**: Biotek plate reader for UV-Vis measurements  
- **Photoreactor**: RPi Pico-controlled synthesis chamber
- **Lash_E Coordinator**: Master controller class (`master_usdl_coordinator.py`) that orchestrates all instruments

The system runs **closed-loop optimization workflows** where Bayesian optimizers (BayBe/Ax) suggest experimental conditions, robots execute experiments, analyzers process results, and recommenders suggest the next round.

## Core Development Patterns

### 1. Simulation-First Development
```python
# ALWAYS support simulation mode for development/testing
SIMULATE = True  # Set in workflow config
lash_e = Lash_E(vial_file, simulate=SIMULATE)

# Conditional hardware initialization
if not simulate:
    from north import NorthC9
    c9 = NorthC9("A", network_serial="AU06CNCF")
else:
    from unittest.mock import MagicMock
    c9 = MagicMock()
```

### 2. YAML-Driven Configuration
All robot state and configuration stored in YAML files under `robot_state/`:
- `robot_status.yaml` - Dynamic robot state (pipet usage, gripper status)
- `track_status.yaml` - Wellplate positions and counts
- `robot_hardware.yaml` - Axis mappings, speeds, physical constants
- `vial_positions.yaml` - Physical locations for vials/labware

**Critical**: Always validate YAML files before workflows using `check_input_file()` methods.

### 3. Workflow Structure Pattern
```python
# Standard workflow initialization
INPUT_VIAL_STATUS_FILE = "status/experiment_vials.csv"
lash_e = Lash_E(INPUT_VIAL_STATUS_FILE, simulate=SIMULATE)
lash_e.nr_robot.check_input_file()  # MANDATORY validation
lash_e.nr_track.check_input_file()  # MANDATORY validation

# Move to working position
lash_e.nr_robot.move_vial_to_location("target_vial", "clamp", 0)

# Get fresh wellplate for measurements
lash_e.nr_track.get_new_wellplate()
```

### 4. Error Handling & Slack Integration
```python
# Unified error pattern via North_Base.pause_after_error()
self.pause_after_error("Error description", send_slack=True)
# Automatically logs, sends Slack notification, pauses for human intervention
```

## Key File Locations

### Primary Controllers
- `master_usdl_coordinator.py` - Lash_E orchestrator class
- `North_Safe.py` - Core robot control classes (North_Robot, North_Track, etc.)
- `biotek_new.py` - Cytation 5 plate reader interface

### Workflows Directory
- `workflows/calibration_sdl_*.py` - Pipetting parameter optimization
- `workflows/CMC_*.py` - Critical micelle concentration experiments  
- `workflows/color_*.py` - Color matching optimization
- Each workflow follows: initialization → validation → execution → analysis

### Configuration Management
- `status/` - CSV vial definitions and YAML state files
- `robot_state/` - Hardware configuration YAMLs
- `settings/` - Protocol and experimental parameters

### Analysis & Recommendations
- `analysis/` - Data processing and result extraction
- `recommenders/` - Bayesian optimization using BayBe/Ax frameworks
- Both support parameter fixing and selective optimization

## Development Practices

- Start with minimal, lean implementations focused on proof-of-concept
- ALWAYS validate status files before workflows using `check_input_file()`
- Use `simulate=True` for development - no hardware required
- Follow the Lash_E → validation → execution → analysis pattern
- Avoid creating new files until asked; extend existing workflow patterns
- Set environment variables `PIP_TIMEOUT=600` and `PIP_RETRIES=2` before installs
- Each code change should update CHANGELOG.md with semantic versioning

### MANDATORY: Automatic Backup Protocol
**ALWAYS create backups before making significant code changes:**

```powershell
# Create timestamped backup before any major edit
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd_HHmmss"
Copy-Item "path/to/file.py" "backups/file_backup_$timestamp.py"
```

**Required for:**
- Any `replace_string_in_file` operation on files >500 lines
- Modifying critical workflow files (calibration_sdl_*, master_usdl_*, North_Safe.py)
- Adding new functions or classes to existing files
- Any change that affects core system functionality

**Backup naming convention:**
- `backups/filename_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.py`
- Include descriptive suffix for major changes: `_before_conditional_replication`

**Recovery protocol:**
- If changes fail or break functionality, immediately restore from most recent backup
- Test backup restoration: `Copy-Item "backups/file_backup_*.py" "original/path/file.py" -Force`
- Keep backups for at least the duration of the coding session

## Debugging Best Practices

### Always Start with Data, Not Assumptions
- **FIRST**: Ask user to show actual data (CSV files, terminal output, logs)
- **NEVER** assume code is working as designed - verify with real examples
- **TRACE systematically**: Follow data flow from input → processing → output
- **Example**: "Show me the actual CSV/raw data" before analyzing code

### Debugging Best Practices

#### Always Start with Data, Not Assumptions
- **FIRST**: Ask user to show actual data (CSV files, terminal output, logs)
- **NEVER** assume code is working as designed - verify with real examples
- **TRACE systematically**: Follow data flow from input → processing → output
- **Example**: "Show me the actual CSV/raw data" before analyzing code

#### Look for Simple Inconsistencies First
- When issues only happen in one mode (simulation vs real), check for **return value differences**
- **Compare similar code paths** - simulation vs real robot, different volume handling, etc.
- **Fix obvious inconsistencies** before building complex theories
- **Trust user clues** about when/where problems occur

## Communication Style

- Use minimal emoji and special symbols
- Ask clarifying questions when needed about hardware setup or experimental parameters
- Put documentation in comment replies, not separate files unless asked
- Include direct hyperlinks with shortened (7-character) commit hashes when referencing files

## Confidence and Collaboration Guidelines

### Express Uncertainty Appropriately
- **AVOID**: "This will fix it" or "The problem is definitely X"
- **USE**: "This might help" or "One possibility is..." or "Let's try..."
- **CAVEAT**: Explicitly mention when suggestions are untested theories vs proven solutions

### Respect User Expertise
- User has real hardware, real consequences, and domain knowledge
- Ask "Does this match what you're seeing?" rather than assuming
- Suggest collaborative investigation: "Should we check..." vs prescriptive fixes
- When uncertain, say "You know your setup better - does this approach make sense?"

### Incremental Changes Over Confident Overhauls  
- Suggest small, reversible changes first
- Ask permission before major modifications to working systems
- Offer to help user investigate rather than confidently diagnosing
- "Would you rather try a simpler approach first?" for complex fixes
